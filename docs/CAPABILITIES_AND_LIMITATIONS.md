# Roundabout — Capabilities and Limitations

A snapshot of what the solver can and can't do today. Sourced from `ROADMAP_OCEAN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the current state of the codebase. Every "can't" item below is something the codebase doesn't do yet — not a hard "won't"; consult the roadmap for project-scope tags and validation criteria for the planned items.

> **Scope note.** The `sim_type='coastal'` regime — the A-grid HLL/HLLC path, the unstructured triangular (KNP central-upwind) backend, the semi-implicit (Casulli) free surface, the non-hydrostatic extension, and the C/Python FFI — was split out into a **separate repository**. This tree is ocean-only, and nothing below describes those paths.

*Last reconciled against the codebase: 2026-08-23 (coastal carve-out).*

For the full feature checklist (planned, validated, in flight, deferred), see `ROADMAP_OCEAN.md`. For namelist / config keys + physics, see `REFERENCE.md`; for the per-closure shipped surface, `CLOSURE_MATRIX.md`. For acronyms (CWC, PGF, PP81, ALE, EPBL, MEKE, …) and concept definitions (vanishing layer, conservative soft clamp, mode split, …), see `codebase/CONCEPTS.md`.

**Regime status**: one path, `sim_type='ocean'` — Tier-1 operational as of
2026-05-24. Arakawa C-grid + continuity-PPM + split-explicit RK2 + Wright
EOS + Smagorinsky KH/AH + KPP + ALE remap. The MOM6-reference double-gyre
setup runs stable to day 580 on a single V100. Most physics slots are
wired; deferred work is the Hollingsworth-Källén Coriolis correction,
full KPP (V_t² + non-local), non-hydrostatic on the C-grid, and parts of
the MPI surface (see [*MPI (domain decomposition)*](#mpi-domain-decomposition)
for what decomposes bit-identically and what is refused). See the [**Ocean path**](#ocean-path-sim_typeocean)
section for the detailed shipped surface — it is the authority for
everything below. Production-ready for regional hydrostatic ocean
configurations within those limits.

## Time-step constraint — read this first

> **The ocean path is not gravity-wave-CFL-bound.** `sim_type='ocean'` is **split-explicit**: the barotropic (gravity-wave) mode is sub-cycled in a fast forward-backward loop (`&ocean_bt_nml auto_n_inner` derives the substep count from the gravity-wave CFL once at configure, per wet cell), so the **outer/baroclinic `Δt` is bounded by advective/baroclinic CFL, not by `dx/√(gH)`** — O(minutes), e.g. `dt=1200 s` in the MOM6-reference double gyre.

The driver requires a fixed outer step (`&time_nml dt_fixed > 0`); there is no adaptive-CFL helper on this path.

**The outer split scheme is a real choice with a measured price on each side** (`&ocean_bt_nml split_scheme`, both shipped, both under test).

* **`"pred_corr"` (DEFAULT since 2026-09-14)** — the MOM6 predictor-corrector: `pc_be`-off-centred predictor, slow tendencies on the `u_av`/`h_av` step time-means, one prognostic update in the corrector, forward-backward gravity-wave pairing. Neutrally stable to `ω·dt = 2`: it removes the resting-state growth described below, lifts the internal-wave `dt` ceiling, and leaves the Eady benchmark's physical baroclinic mode intact and slightly stronger (max|v| ×2074 over 60 days vs ×1480). Its per-step cost is the same order as `ssp_rk2`'s — `coriolis_coast`, 48²×4, 20 simulated days on one V100: 70.3 s under pred_corr vs 65.9 s under ssp_rk2, about 7 % more. `validate_config` refuses it **fail-loud** outside its v1 envelope (`eulerian_z`, `&ocean_wetdry_nml enable`, `dt_tracer_advect_ratio > 1`); six shipped namelists pin `ssp_rk2` for one of those reasons. **Its own residual limit:** it does not ELIMINATE the resting-state growth, it slows it ~36× (83-day e-folding against ssp_rk2's 2.5-day one), so `resting_stratified_channel` stays a scoped XFAIL on the *settle* gate under the default — it passes the magnitude gate with margin.
* **`"ssp_rk2"` (EXPERIMENTAL)** — two identical stages + SSP average; widest envelope (every vcoord including `eulerian_z`, `&ocean_wetdry_nml enable`, `dt_tracer_advect_ratio > 1`) and the only scheme wired through windowed tracer advection. It remains **fully supported and fully tested** — the stability suite runs an `ssp_rk2` twin of every case whose namelist does not pin a scheme — and *experimental* is a label on the ANSWER, not a deprecation of the code path. **The defect, quantified:** the two-stage average amplifies an internal gravity wave by `√(1+(ω·dt)⁴/4)` per step, so it manufactures energy out of a motionless stratified state. On `validation_examples/ocean/eady/resting_stratified_channel.nml` — flat bed, periodic, stably stratified, at rest, ±0.5 mK seed, **no energy source of any kind** — En reaches **2.992E-05 m²/s² at day 25** (7.7 mm/s rms) and is still climbing on a 2.5-day e-folding; `pred_corr` on the identical file holds **1.739E-09** (**17 000×** less, 83-day e-folding). The outer time splitting is the cause and everything else was **exonerated** by direct substitution: the Coriolis form (`sadourny_hk`, `sadourny_energy`), the ALE remap (`vcoord = sigma`) and the PGF form (`fv_lite`) each moved the answer by < 0.1 %, `eady_dT_dz = 0` dropped En 119×, and REMOVING the lateral viscosity RAISED it — viscosity damps this mode, it does not cause it. **What it means in practice:** the growth is a `(ω·dt)⁴` noise floor, so what decides whether it matters is how hard `dt` is pushed against the internal-wave period. A forced, energetic, viscous configuration runs decades above that floor and never notices it; a quiescent, weakly-damped, or long-spin-up one does not, and there the manufactured energy IS the signal. Carried as a scoped XFAIL on `resting_stratified_channel__ssp_rk2`.
* **The per-layer bc-PGF retro-correction needs the FV-MOM6 PGF.** `&ocean_bt_nml correction_bc_pgf` (MOM6 `btstep_layer_accel`, default off) builds its per-layer pressure response from the FV-MOM6 interface-height stack. `validate_config` refuses it with `&ocean_pgf_nml form` = `mont` (the default), `fv_lite`, `fv_wright` or `gprime`. Before 2026-10-04 that combination was accepted at configure and then `error stop`ped in step 1.
* **How the default came to move (2026-09-14).** Three things blocked the predictor-corrector and all three are closed. (1) the **land-masked-coastline NaN** — `coriolis_coast` went En 6.98e-07 (day 8) → 2.78e-04 (day 12) → 1.57e-01 (day 16) → NaN (day 18); the cause was the fast-loop Coriolis reference (`subtract_fast_cor_ref`) being evaluated on the stage-entry `u^n` while the slow Coriolis folded into `F_bt` was evaluated on `u_av`, so the uncancelled `f × (v̄_av − v̄^n)` forced every barotropic substep and pumped the basin's gravest Poincaré seiche. With `set_cor_ref_velocity` building the reference from the same velocity (MOM6 `ubt_Cor`), the case holds En 2.0e-07…1.1e-06 for 20 days and exits 0. (2) the **`nz = 1` GPU fault** — the vertical-friction velocity (and tracer) tridiagonals indexed 0 at a single layer; both now carry a single-layer path that puts the wind stress and the bottom drag in the one row. (3) the **seven GPU-only unit-test failures** that stood after those two — five non-finite within 1-5 steps (`periodic`, `obc_baroclinic`, `dyn_split`, `ice_restart`, `wetdry`) plus `restart` bit-exactness and uniform-`p_surf` gauge invariance, green on gfortran throughout. All seven had ONE cause, in the GPU data path rather than the scheme: `scratch_3d_buffer_t%enter_data` attached its payload with `!$acc enter data create`, which copies no host value, while the `pred_corr` PREDICTOR deliberately reads `hv%du_visc`/`dv_visc` without recomputing them (MOM6's `diffu(u[n-1])` reuse) — and at step 1 there is no previous producer, so the host read the zero `init` promised and the device read the allocator's leftovers. `enter_data` now device-zeroes the payload, gated by `rdb_test_scratch_3d_device`, and the suite is **187/187 on both toolchains**. The flip re-baselined every shipped answer and every golden for the ~54 of 64 namelists that do not pin a scheme; the six that pin `ssp_rk2` and the four that pin `pred_corr` are unchanged.

Several individual operators are additionally unconditionally stable on their sub-problem: vertical viscosity/diffusion is a backward-Euler tridiagonal per column, bottom drag and wind stress can be folded into that same solve (`&ocean_vdiff_nml implicit_drag` / `implicit_stress`), and Coriolis is the closed-form rotation.

This is a **sub-cycled fast mode, not a semi-implicit free surface**. Roundabout does not treat the gravity-wave term implicitly in the SCHISM/Casulli sense; the barotropic substeps resolve it explicitly, just at their own smaller `Δt`.

## Solver core

**Structured Arakawa C-grid, hydrostatic, Boussinesq.** Layer thickness is prognostic (continuity-PPM transport, no Poisson constraint); momentum is vector-invariant with a Sadourny PV-flux Coriolis-advection operator and a finite-volume pressure gradient; the vertical coordinate is ALE (advance Lagrangian, remap conservatively). Horizontal grids: `cartesian`, `spherical`, `supergrid` (MOM6 mosaic), `tripolar` (Murray 1996 cap + north fold, local on one rank row or distributed across an east-west split).

The full operator-by-operator surface, with knobs and limits, is in the [Ocean path](#ocean-path-sim_typeocean) section below.

## Physics gaps (cross-cutting)

> Everything **shipped** is enumerated in the [Ocean path](#ocean-path-sim_typeocean) section. This list is the standing gaps.

- **GLS, k-ω / MY2.5** turbulence closures. Shipped instead: PP81 interior, KPP boundary layer (default on), EPBL (`&ocean_epbl_nml`), kappa-shear (`&ocean_kappa_shear_nml`), tidal mixing, convective adjustment, double diffusion, and two mutually exclusive background schemes.
- **TEOS-10 GSW in-situ EOS branch.** Wright (1997) and a Roquet et al. (2015) polynomial ship; a full GSW branch does not.
- **Sediment transport, biogeochemistry, vegetation drag.** No source terms beyond the surface/bottom flux set.
- **Online bulk aerodynamic flux formulae** (Zeng / COARE). Forcing must be pre-computed to model-grid `τ`, `Q_net`, `E−P` — there is no in-model conversion from `(U10, T_air, q_air, SST, SLP)`.
- **Sea ice** is a dynamical core + column model, not a complete ice model — no ridging, melt ponds or lateral melt; see the [Sea ice](#sea-ice) subsection and "What Roundabout is not".

---

## Forcing (ocean path)

### Shipped
- Wind stress (programmatic / analytic profiles; `&ocean_surface_*`).
- **Time-varying NetCDF surface forcing** (`&ocean_dataovr_nml`, default off) — wind stress, heat, salt, evaporation and liquid precipitation bound to pre-regridded model-grid files through the shared PR-14 reader. See the full entry in the ocean-physics list below for the tag table, the `enable_components` destination rule, and the v1 limits (shared time mode across tags, single-rank).
- Surface heat + salt flux, shortwave penetration, surface buoyancy restoring.
- Equilibrium body-force tide + scalar SAL + boundary-tide nodal correction.
- **Atmospheric surface-pressure loading / inverse barometer** (`&ocean_psurf_nml enable`, default off ⇒ byte-identical). `η_ib = −p_surf/(ρ₀·g_bt)` is folded into the barotropic `eta_forcing` seam, so the momentum feels `−(1/ρ₀)∇p_surf` — an atmospheric high depresses SSH ~1 cm/hPa. Composes additively with the equilibrium tide + scalar SAL on the same seam; ρ₀ from `eos%rho0`. **v1 fill is a uniform scalar** (`p_surf_const`, seeded into `sf%p_surf_atm`) which is provably inert (only ∇p_surf is physical) — a genuine load needs `p_surf` wired up as an `&ocean_dataovr_nml` tag (the reader ships; `p_surf` is not yet one of its tags). Requires `&ocean_forcing_nml enable_components=.true.` (reads `sf%p_surf`), the split solver (`n_inner ≥ 1`), and is mutually exclusive with `&ocean_bt_nml bt_halo > 0` — an explicit width fails loud at configure, and the `bt_halo` AUTO default (the multi-rank `-1` sentinel) resolves to 0 under psurf rather than to the wide-halo march-in.

- **`p_surf` in the EOS's IN-SITU pressure argument** (`&ocean_psurf_nml in_eos`, default off ⇒ byte-identical) — the ice-shelf-cavity seam. The assembled `sf%p_surf` is copied once per outer step into `multilayer_state_t%p_top` (Pa, always allocated, zero-filled, device-mapped, counted in `bytes()`), and the ported **in-situ** builder measures its hydrostatic pressure down from `p_top` instead of from 0 Pa at the free surface. Under 1e6–2e7 Pa of ice load the old `p = 0` assumption is a systematic ~4–5 kg/m³ density error with the Wright EOS.
  **Ported:** the FV-Wright Picard column sweep (`&ocean_pgf_nml form="fv_wright"`), and — since Phase 4b — the **EPBL column stack** (`&ocean_epbl_nml`). With neither selected, `in_eos` is a **documented no-op** and configure emits a rank-0 warning saying so (the load's depth-uniform gradient already reaches the momentum through the barotropic `eta_forcing` seam, so adding it in the PGF as well would double-count).
  **EPBL specifics.** `epbl_column_kernel` seeds its `pres`/`p_mid` stack at `ms%p_top(i,j)`, gated by the host scalar `ocean_epbl_t%in_eos` that `configure_ocean_epbl` latches before `enter_data`. That gate is **not** redundant with `p_top` being the zero array: a cavity fills `p_top` with the ice load whether or not `in_eos` is set, so the gate is the only thing keeping an existing cavity + EPBL run bit-identical (`epbl_p_top_off_is_bit_identical` compares a 3 MPa load against a zero one and demands byte equality). The seed moves **both** consumers of that stack — the in-situ argument of `eos_specvol_derivs` and the PE weight `dpe = dmass·p_mid·dSV` — because they are the same pressure: the hydrostatic load a layer's centre of mass has to lift, and under a shelf that floats with the water it sits on, the ice is part of that load. A **uniform** load must therefore still be pure gauge, and is: under a linear (pressure-independent) EOS the offset enters only as `pec_core → pec_core + P·colht_core`, and `colht_core` — the column-height change of a mixing event — is identically zero because mixing at fixed mass conserves `Σ mass·T` and `Σ mass·S`. Measured difference on gfortran 15.1: exactly zero. Under the nonlinear Wright EOS the same 3 MPa load **does** move the diffusivity, through `α(p)`/`β(p)` alone — which is the point of the port. Tests: `test_ocean_bl_under_ice` (`epbl_p_top_*`).
  **Deliberately NOT touched:** `ms%rho_layer`, which is a **potential** density at the horizontally uniform `&ocean_eos_nml p_ref`. Its consumers difference it along a layer (Montgomery PGF, FV-lite integrand; the FV-MOM6-PCM integrand only for the linear EOS or with `&ocean_pgf_nml insitu_density = .false.` — by default a pressure-dependent EOS is evaluated there at the in-situ pressure, MOM6 PCM parity — in closed form under Wright (MOM6 `int_density_dz_wright`, about the cost of the potential-density integral), by 5-point Boole quadrature under Roquet (no closed form for `∫dz/SV(p)`; the (T, S) part of the SpV polynomial evaluated once per sub-column and inlined into the kernel, global 1° `ocean_pgf` 2.5 s vs Wright's 1.9 s and 1.1 s for the potential-density integral) — because a single-reference potential density under-states the deep horizontal density gradient) and vertically (the vmix N² builders), so a per-column reference pressure would give two columns of identical water at the same geopotential depth densities differing by `∂ρ/∂p·Δp_top` (≈ 2 kg/m³ across a calving front) — a spurious along-layer density gradient and hence a spurious PGF. N² is therefore unchanged by `in_eos` and stays self-consistent. Guarded by `rho_layer_independent_of_p_top`.
  **Refused fail-loud with `in_eos = .true.`** (each builds its own surface-relative *in-situ* hydrostatic pressure from 0 Pa and has not been ported): `&ocean_kappa_shear_nml enable`, `&ocean_tidal_mixing_nml enable`, `&ocean_redi_nml enable`, `&ocean_slopes_nml enable`, `&ocean_pgf_nml reconstruct_for_pressure`, `&ocean_ice_nml enable`. `&ocean_epbl_nml enable` was on this list until Phase 4b and is now **accepted** — porting one means deleting its line in the same PR, which is what happened.
- **`p_top` in the FV-MOM6 PGF surface boundary condition** (`&ocean_pgf_nml p_top_in_bc`, default off ⇒ byte-identical) — `pa(nz+1) = ρ_ref·g·η_geo + ms%p_top` instead of `ρ_ref·g·η_geo`, on both the PCM and the `reconstruct_for_pressure` branch. This is the PGF's pressure **boundary condition**, entirely orthogonal to `in_eos`, which is the EOS's pressure **argument**: either, both or neither, and the once-per-outer-step inline refresh of `ms%p_top` fires on the disjunction so neither consumer can read a stale value.
  **Why it is not a double count of the `eta_forcing` seam.** A depth-uniform `p_top` perturbs *every* layer's `PFu` by the same `−(1/ρ₀)∇p_top` (proved in `compute_fv_mom6_impl`'s docstring and pinned by `theorem_depth_uniform_pfu`). Under the default split (`&ocean_bt_nml bc_pgf_forcing`, MOM6 `BT_force`) the depth mean of the layer PGF forces the barotropic mode, so the `p_surf` part of `p_top` is shed from that forcing as `g·∇η_ib` (`set_fast_forcing_eta_pf`) and the seam keeps it once; the static `p_ice_ref` part cancels inside `pa(nz+1)` against the datum-shifted `η_geo`. (Under the legacy `bc_pgf_forcing = .false.` split the whole depth mean was subtracted, so the uniform piece cancelled identically — along with every baroclinic bottom-pressure gradient.) On the **unsplit** driver (`n_inner = 0`) there is no seam, so this term is the load's only path into the momentum.
  **What it buys.** `pa` is an anomaly stack about `ρ_ref·g·z`. Under a 5e6 Pa draft, cancelling the load inside `pa(nz+1)` against `ρ_ref·g·η_geo` keeps the whole stack `O(1e4 Pa)` instead of `O(5e6 Pa)`, shrinking every downstream `h_neglect` face-divisor leak by the same 500×. Build the load with the *same* product as the seed (`(ρ_ref·GRAVITY)·z_draft`) and the cancellation is bit-exact — `isostatic_rest_sloping_load` asserts a bit-zero face force under a sloping draft.
  **Envelope.** FV_MOM6 only — refused fail-loud for every other `form` (`mont` hard-zeroes `M(nz)`; `fv_lite` / `fv_wright` seed `p_edge(nz+1) = 0`, so there is no `pa` stack to inject into). `ms%p_top` has exactly one producer today, the `&ocean_psurf_nml` seam; without `enable` the knob is honestly inert and configure says so. `compute_pbce` stays load-blind on purpose (`pbce = ∂p_k/∂η`, and a static load has no `∂/∂η`). Test: `test_ocean_pgf_p_top_bc`.
- **Static ice-shelf cavity geometry + the barotropic datum** (`&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml enable`, default off ⇒ byte-identical) — a prescribed, time-constant ice draft `z_draft(i,j)` (m, positive down) laid over the bed and absorbed into the reference depth:

      bt_H_ref = b − z_draft   afloat        (was: bt_H_ref = b)
               = 0              where GROUNDED

  so `bt_eta = Σh_layer − bt_H_ref` is the deviation from the **loaded** equilibrium — zero at rest under the shelf — and every consumer of the water-column thickness `D = bt_H_ref + bt_eta` (barotropic continuity face thickness, Chapman phase speed, ALE `remap_h_ref`, the BT↔layer rescale) is correct with no cavity branch of its own. That is Losch (2008) §2.1's own convention ("the 'sea-surface height' η is the deviation from the 'reference' ice-shelf draft h"), not a divergence from it; the alternative (draft carried in η) needs at least eight individual fixes, one of which — `η_sal = β·bt_eta` — would manufacture a permanent −50 m SAL forcing. The **geopotential** interface stack is a different datum and stays absolute (`e_face(1) = −b` from the true bed, so the column top lands at `−z_draft + η` on its own).
  **Geometry:** `draft_config = "flat"` (uniform inside the shelf box, 0 beyond the calving front) or `"linear"` (`d0 + s·(x−x0)`, clipped at 0); `draft_source = "thickness"` converts an ice thickness by flotation (`ρ_ice·h/ρ₀`). Box corners are metres, converted to GRID units at the dispatch (degrees on a spherical grid — the `slope_scale` trap); the setters fill the FULL array including ghosts and then ride the bathymetry's own periodic/fold re-wrap + halo sequence. `±1e30` on a box corner means "no limit on that side", which is what a shelf reaching a wall needs.
  **Grounding:** a column with less than `h_min_cavity` (default 10 m) of water under the ice is LAND, through the SAME `seed_wet_mask_impl` the bathymetry uses — so the static metric-zeroing mask and the land-state contract (`h_layer = H_VANISHED`, `hTr = 0`) follow for free. **Never MOM6's thin film of water under grounded ice.** Grounding more than `grounded_max_frac` of the interior fails loud; a draft over pre-existing land is zeroed with a logged count.
  **A grounded column's datum is `0`, and the counted-once invariant is a WET-column statement.** `bt_H_ref` is the reference WATER-COLUMN thickness; a grounded column has none, and `b − z_draft` there is negative by hundreds of metres. So `cavity_datum_impl` writes `0` and `cavity_datum_residual` asserts `ρ_ref·g·z_draft + (bt_H_ref − b)·ρ_ref·g ≡ 0` over the wet columns only — not a weakening, because (I) is a statement about the barotropic momentum equation and a land column carries none (every face metric on it is zero). On ordinary land under a cavity the two rules agree exactly: the draft is forced to 0 there, so the grounded branch writes `0`, which IS `b`. Carrying the negative value instead put a phantom few-hundred-metre `bt_eta` on every grounded column (masked out of the dynamics, visible in `eta` min/max and the `ssh` diagnostic) and made the ALE land target a cancellation of two draft-sized numbers, so land thickness jittered at `eps·z_draft` rather than sitting bit-stably at `H_VANISHED`. Gate: `test_ocean_cavity_grounded_budget`.
  **Conservation under grounding — fixed 2026-09-20.** A grounded column's seeded `h_layer` is NEGATIVE, and the old land tracer hold (`val = hTr/max(h_old, H_VANISHED)`, then `hTr = val·H_VANISHED`) is an exact algebraic identity for `h_old ≤ H_VANISHED`: it left a FULL-COLUMN `hTr` beside a floored thickness, the budget latch integrated it, and the first ALE regrid discarded it un-budgeted. On `validation_examples/ocean/isomip_plus/ocean0_idealised_draft.nml` (39.4 % grounded) that was a **step change of 0.609 in the relative salt residual and −0.080 in heat** between step 0 and step 1, flat thereafter, while mass closed at `−5e-14`. It scaled with the grounded columns' summed DEPTH DEFICIT, not their area. A land T-cell now holds `h_layer = H_VANISHED` and `hTr = 0` — the state every vanished-gated operator already holds it at — and the same run reads `−5.2e-14` / `6.5e-14`. No wet cell was ever affected: the twin gate runs the same 64 cells as grounded ice and as ordinary island land and finds every wet column BITWISE equal after 20 steps. Gates: `test_ocean_cavity_grounded_budget` (1e-12 relative, every step from step 0, melt off and melt on), and the `isomip_plus_ocean0_idealised` stability row.
  **Gate:** `test_ocean_cavity_equivalence` — with a FLAT lid, a cavity over a 1000 m bed evolves like a cavity-free 500 m ocean: bit-identical at t = 0, and after six `pred_corr` steps of stratified wind-driven flow the prognostics agree to a derived round-off bound. UNLOADED (the P5.1 datum-only path, still expressible because a uniform load is provably inert): `3.1e-13 m/s` against `3.1e-11`. LOADED (P5.2): `1.3e-18 m/s` against `3.1e-17`, with `h_layer` and `bt_eta` agreeing EXACTLY — **the load buys 2.4e5×**, because the `C = ρ_ref·g·500 ≈ 5.08e6 Pa` offset the unloaded `pa` stack carries is cancelled inside `pa(nz+1)` and the stack returns to its ~5 Pa anomaly scale. Both are on a signal of `3.5e-3 m/s`. Unit coverage: `test_ocean_cavity_draft`.

- **The ice-shelf cavity LOAD, wired end to end** (`&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml` + `&ocean_pgf_nml p_top_in_bc`) — `metrics%p_ice_ref = (ρ_ref·GRAVITY)·z_draft` is assembled into the top-of-column pressure

  ```
  multilayer_state_t%p_top = metrics%p_ice_ref + sf%p_surf
  ```

  at configure (final for a cavity without the psurf seam — the draft is static) and, when the psurf seam makes `sf%p_surf` live, once per outer step as an inline `do concurrent` in `ocean_dyn_step_split`. Consumers: the FV-MOM6 `pa(nz+1)` boundary condition, the in-situ EOS pressure, and the ice-shelf basal-melt liquidus (below) — three consumers, one pressure.

  **The partition, and what it is for.** The load reaches the **barotropic** mode through the datum and nothing else, and the **pressure** through `p_top` and nothing else. It is deliberately NOT added to `sf%p_surf`, because `eta_ib = −p_surf/(ρ₀·g_bt)` is built from that total and would re-inject what the datum already carries; only the load *anomaly* — which for the Boussinesq-isostatic default IS `sf%p_surf` — reaches the `eta_forcing` seam. So an inverse-barometer run with no cavity is bit-identical, and a cavity with `p_surf = 0` sends the seam nothing: switching the seam on at `p_surf = 0` under a cavity is BIT-identical to not having it (`cavity_seam_zero_p_surf_inert`).

  **`p_top_in_bc` is REQUIRED, fail-loud, when the draft varies** — refused at configure on the filled `z_draft` and in `validate_config` on the namelist shape, never auto-enabled. A UNIFORM draft is exempt: a load with no gradient is bit-identically inert in the top BC. The refusal protects the raw `pa` stack (5e6 Pa off its anomaly scale), the unsplit driver (which would feel a raw `g·∇z_draft ≈ 2e-2 m/s²`) and any non-uniform barotropic-correction weight (which redistributes an uncancelled depth-uniform force as a real per-layer shear). It is **not** a blow-up guard for the default split path: a depth-uniform load is baroclinically inert and the split replaces the depth mean, so a missing load there costs conditioning, not stability.

  **Physics gate — a resting loaded cavity stays at rest** (`test_ocean_cavity_load`). Sloping draft (`linear`, `s = 1e-3`), flat bed, linear EOS, isopycnals FLAT in geopotential z (the sigma layers tilt with the ice base, so the temperature is set from layer-centre geopotential height, not from the layer index), at rest, `f = 0`, no forcing, `pred_corr`, `sigma`, 40 × 300 s. The only surviving force is the sigma-coordinate PGF truncation, which has a formula:

  ```
  PFu(k) − ⟨PFu⟩_h = N²·D³·(3σ_k²−1)/(12·dx·H̄),   D = s·dx
  ```

  — second order in `dx`, cubic in the slope, independent of `nz`. **Measured `max|u| = 7.08e-8 m/s`** against the derived `a_peak·t = 1.04e-7 m/s` (asserted with a ×4 safety, 5.9× margin); the unit-level deviation matches the formula to **1.2 %**. With the stratification removed (`N² = 0`, every trapezoid error `G(K)` identically zero) the residual falls five decades to `2.6e-13 m/s`. For scale, the figure the Phase-5 design quotes for quiet linear-stratification cavity cases *with* the sloping-coordinate PGF corrections is `O(1e-9 m/s)`; this build carries none of those corrections yet, and `7.08e-8` is their baseline. (The design also records that the paper that figure is attributed to is not the paper in `papers/` — see `test_ocean_cavity_load`'s header.)

  **The Phase-6 baseline, measured end to end.** `validation_examples/ocean/ice_shelf_cavity/` ships three quiescent cavities that differ by one ingredient each (flat lid / sloping lid + uniform density / sloping lid + ISOMIP+ COLD stratification), all with zero viscosity, zero drag and zero mixing so nothing can damp a pressure-gradient regression out of sight. Measured, gfortran Release, 48 × 6 × 15 @ 2 km, 30 days: the **flat lid is EXACTLY `0.000E+00`** (every interface gap `Δe(K) = 0`, so every trapezoid error is structurally absent) and the **uniform-density sloping lid is `1.34E-20`** (machine zero — the load bookkeeping is exact), while the **stratified sloping lid holds the derived `N²D³/(6·dx·H̄)` plateau, En `1.0–2.1E-09`, for 20 days and then leaves it on a ~3.2-day e-folding**, reaching `3.04E-08` at day 30 and saturating at `3.89E-06` (2.8 mm/s rms) by day 60 with budgets still exact. That growth is **bounded and diagnosed**: `dt` 600→300 reproduces it (so it is not an outer-split `(ω·dt)ⁿ` mode), ISOMIP+'s own `nu_h = 6` and a `dx⁴`-scaled biharmonic each only DELAY it ~10 days, and both bit-zero siblings say the sloping-lid PGF error is its whole source. It is carried as a scoped XFAIL on `energy:rest-settles`, gates at `REST_1MM_S`, and **does not** reach the `REST_100UM_S` the design proposed — restoring that is Phase 6's acceptance criterion. For scale, Yung, Hallberg, Adcroft & Morrison (2026), *JAMES* **18**, e2025MS005645 report `O(1e-9 m/s)` "in quiet, linear stratification test cases" for their CORRECTED algorithm (σ icemount `1e-7 → 1e-12`, their §5.1.2) on runs that carry a Laplacian viscosity and top/bottom drag; this build implements none of their three corrections (nonlinear surface-pressure reconstruction, interior reference interface, MWIPG) and reads `|u|_rms = 5.7e-05 m/s` at their 10-day horizon with no dissipation at all.

  **Stretched `z_fixed` nominal layers — `&vcoord_nml z_fixed_profile`** (default `"uniform"` ⇒ byte-identical). `z_fixed` used to know only UNIFORM nominal layers (`max_depth/nz`: 130 m each at 50 levels over a 6500 m ocean — unusable on a global grid). `"list"` takes the thicknesses from `z_fixed_dz` (surface first); `"tanh"` ramps from exactly `z_fixed_dz_top` at the surface to an emergent bed thickness summing to `max_depth` (2 m → ~250 m at 50 levels over 6500 m). One table (`ocean_vcoord_t%z_fixed_zi`/`z_fixed_dz`) is read by the target builder, so the closed-face mask, `k_top`, the partial top cell under a draft (threshold `0.1×` that layer's own nominal thickness), the bed partial cell and the on-target IC seed (cavity, or `&ocean_zinit_nml`) all follow it. Gate: `test_ocean_zfixed_stretched` (hand-derived columns: flat bed, partial bed, partial top + sliver merge under a draft, a stretched closed-face staircase; and a resting stratified flat-lid cavity on a tanh stack that stays at EXACTLY zero velocity for 60 steps). Not yet: reading a 1-D `vgrid` NetCDF file (the list covers it by hand), and the `thickness_config = "uniform_z"` seed, which still lays uniform interfaces (the first remap moves them onto the profile).

  **The first z-like coordinate under a shelf: `vcoord_type = "z_fixed"`** (P6.2, 2026-09-20; cavity off ⇒ byte-identical, `z_top = 0` ⇒ bit-identical even with the cavity on). `Z_FIXED` is the one z-like family `validate_config` now accepts alongside `sigma`/`zstar` under `&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml`. It measures its nominal interface depths from `z = 0` (`(nz−k)·h_nominal − η`, `h_nominal = &ocean_topo_nml max_depth / nz_layers`) and clips that stack against a new per-column input, `ocean_vcoord_t%z_top(i,j)` — the geopotential depth of the top of the WATER column, filled once at configure from `metrics%z_draft` and `0` everywhere else. Layers whose nominal range lies entirely inside the ice vanish to the inert filler `zstar_h_min` and stack under the ice base; the layer that straddles the base is a **partial top cell**, cut at the draft and debited for the fillers above it; the bed side is unchanged (fillers below the bed, a partial bottom cell that absorbs `η` and the bed debt). Slivers are refused at BOTH ends: the bed's threshold is `zstar_h_min` (today's rule, kept bit-for-bit), the top's is `0.1·h_nominal` — MITgcm's `hFacMin`, the minimum partial-cell fraction Losch (2008) §2.1 used for this exact problem — and a thinner cut merges into the layer below. `Σ target_h = H + η` is closed by construction with one rule that survives both ends vanishing. This is Yung, Hallberg, Adcroft & Morrison (2026), *JAMES* **18**, e2025MS005645, Fig. 1b: quasi-z layers are geopotential and vanish where they outcrop into the ice base. Under a cavity the IC also seeds `h_layer` directly from the target (`η = 0`) so the zinit overlay evaluates T/S at the running coordinate's own layer centres and the first remap is an identity (since 2026-09-30 the same on-target seed is used WITHOUT a cavity whenever `&ocean_zinit_nml` sets T/S; `z_fixed` with a per-layer-index `&tracer_nml` IC keeps the sigma-style seed); the fillers are seeded holding their donor live layer's concentration (`hTr = h·c_live`, invariant I1′ — `src/core/ocean/README.md`, "The vanished-layer content rule"), established column-conservatively by the host twin of the enforcement point, so no step-0 budget jump appears. Unit gate: `test_ocean_vcoord_zfixed_cavity` (6 cases — bit-identity at `z_top = 0` asserted with `==`, interface DEPTHS not just the sum, the stepping first-live index, the sliver merge, `η` placement, both ends vanishing). The per-family depth gate `test_ocean_vcoord_interface_depths` carried the OLD, wrong placement as a `documents_*` case with the intended table written beside it; that case is now FLIPPED and asserts `e(K) = −max((nz−K)·h_nominal, z_top)`, with a twin asserting that at `z_top = 0` every target thickness is reproduced bit-for-bit. (`VCOORD_ZSTAR_FULL`'s `documents_*` case is untouched — its per-column table is still built from the true bed, P6.11.)

  **What it buys, and what it does not — measured, and the honest answer is "not yet".** The interior tilt really is gone: `cavity_flat_lid_rest_zfixed.nml` (a UNIFORM draft, so every column vanishes the same layers and cuts at the same depth ⇒ every `Δe(K) ≡ 0`, fillers included) is **`En = 0.000E+00` at every daily sample to 30 days**, mass and salt residuals `−1.8e-12`/`−2.0e-12` relative at day 30 and exactly `0.000E+00` at step 0. That is the P6.2 gate and it is met. But with a **SLOPING** draft the tilt is replaced by the ice-base **staircase** — where the draft crosses a nominal level the two columns' filler counts differ by one and the interface offset across that face jumps by up to `h_nominal` — and the FV-MOM6 acceleration in a vanished layer is `h`-INDEPENDENT. Measured on the same 48 × 6 × 15 @ 2 km sloping-lid geometry as the σ leg: **step-1 acceleration `6.62E-08 m s⁻²` rms against σ's `1.40E-09` — 47× WORSE — and the run NaNs during day 18** where the σ leg completes at `3.04E-08`. On the ISOMIP+ idealised geometry at rest, adiabatic (melt, sponge, convection off, `κ_H = 0`, `ν_H = 6`), the σ leg reaches day 2 (`En 3.43E-06`) and NaNs during day 3 — the runaway on record — and the **z_fixed leg NaNs within day 1**. So the coordinate change ALONE does not rescue ISOMIP+; it moves the error from the interior to the ice base, where it is currently larger. Note the mechanism is NOT the filler-DENSITY term the Phase-6 design derives (`2.0E-8 m s⁻²` from `ρ' = −27.6 kg m⁻³`): `eos_linear_impl` already substitutes `(T_ref, S_ref)` for `h ≤ H_VANISHED`, so with `rho_ref = rho_0` a filler's density anomaly is exactly zero and that term is absent here. It is the geometry term, and it needs Yung's §3.3.1 (vanished-layer vertical-viscosity upwinding), §3.3.2 (top-side MWIPG) and §3.2 (interior reference interface), in that order. `cavity_sloping_lid_rest_zfixed.nml` ships as the measurement and is deliberately NOT in the stability manifest until they land. The configure WARNING for a varying draft under `z_fixed` says which state you are in: with `&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces` OFF it is the numbers above (NOT VALIDATED, does not survive 30 days); with it ON the staircase faces are closed, the sloping-lid case completes 30 days and ISOMIP+ Ocean0 runs 30 days, but the residual on the faces left open is still ~2 decades above the σ leg, so it is EXPERIMENTAL (next paragraph).

  **Partial-step z-level face closure — `&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces`** (default off ⇒ byte-identical, demonstrated: the sloping-lid `z_fixed` case with the knob absent is byte-identical to the pre-change binary across its whole console-stats stream, NaN included). Under `z_fixed` a layer whose nominal geopotential range lies inside the bed — or inside the ice draft — is an inert filler of thickness `zstar_h_min` (`≤ H_VANISHED`). A velocity face at which that layer is a filler on EITHER side was left OPEN, and the FV pressure gradient across the resulting staircase step drove `|ρ′|·g·Δz_step/(ρ₀·dx)` out of a resting stratified state — independent of the filler thickness, so no `h`-gate could reach it. A z-LEVEL model treats such a face as a **WALL** for that layer (Adcroft, Hill & Marshall 1997; Losch 2008 §2.1 for the ice-shelf cavity): no normal velocity, no mass or tracer flux, **free-slip**. The knob builds that wall as a STATIC per-layer 0/1 face mask (`ocean_metrics_t%open_u/open_v`, `(nx+1,ny,nz)`/`(nx,ny+1,nz)`), laid ONCE at configure by the `pure` builder `ocean_vcoord_closed_face_masks` from the same `ocean_vcoord_z_fixed_target` at `η = 0` that the ALE regrid and the IC seed use — one definition of "live". It is static because the bed and the draft are static and `η` is absorbed by the first LIVE layer (to first order in `η/h_partial`: a bed partial cell thinner than `|η|` flips).

  **On `zstar_full` too** (2026-10-02). `build_zref_full` lays a z-level FINE zone (`zstar_h_surf_target`-thick layers from the surface, `nz/3` of them; `zstar_n_surf` and `zstar_stretching` are dead on the ocean path) over a terrain-following COARSE zone, and a column shallower than the fine zone ends in a partial cell with EVERY layer below it a `zstar_h_min` filler — the same staircase, and the same defect: on the 1° Southern Ocean `zstar_full` died at step 10 with the PGF acting at a 61 m layer beside a `1e-4` filler (`vcoord_audit` H2). The knob (name historical) is accepted there and builds the mask from the `ZSTAR_FULL` target at `η = 0` (`ocean_vcoord_eta0_target`, the kernel the regrid dispatches to); every consumer is reused unchanged. Staticness, measured: `η ≥ 0` goes into the surface layer, so nothing flips; `η < 0` is clipped from the bed, and a uniform `η = −1 m` flips 131 of the 1° SO's 25 990 wet columns against `z_fixed`'s 192 (which also flips 144 at `+1 m`). Under `zstar_full` the knob also SEEDS `h_layer` on that target and establishes I1′ on the seeded fillers before the sponge snapshot — a sigma `b/nz` seed would run the sigma PGF at step 1 (0.67 m/s from rest on the 1° SO) and snapshot a `target_source = "ic"` sponge on the wrong layers. Gate: `test_ocean_zstar_full_closed_faces` — a resting stratified 200 m / 30 m shelf break holds `max|u| = 2.5E-17 m/s` over two hours with the mask and reaches `2.58 m/s` with the same state and the knob off. **What it does not fix:** it closes FILLER faces only. The coarse zone's OPEN faces pair terrain-following layers (3642 open wet u face-layers on the 1° SO differ in thickness by more than 10×), and their sigma PGF error is untouched.

  **On `zstar` — MOM6 z\* — too** (2026-10). `vcoord_type = "zstar"` is now MOM6's z\* (`REGRIDDING_COORDINATE_MODE = "Z*"`, `build_zstar_column`, MOM6 `src/ALE/coord_zlike.F90:65-146`), not the sigma branch it used to share: `ocean_vcoord_zstar_target` lays the `z_fixed` nominal profile (the same `z_fixed_zi` table — uniform `max_depth/nz` or `&vcoord_nml z_fixed_profile = "list" | "tanh"`) DILATED per column by `s = (H + η − n_f·h_min)/(H − n_f·h_min)` over `z_fixed`'s partial bed cell and `zstar_h_min` fillers. MOM6 dilates by `(H + η)/H` and then clamps the fillers back to `min_thickness`; keeping the filler stack out of the dilation differs from that by `(s−1)·n_f·h_min` in the partial cell (≤ 0.9 mm at `|η| = 2 m` on the 1° Southern Ocean) and buys two exact properties: (1) every layer's liveness is decided at `η = 0` with `z_fixed`'s bed rule, so the pattern is static BY CONSTRUCTION for `η` of either sign — MOM6's own column is static for the same reason (a nominal interface sits `stretching·(H − Z_k)` above the bed), and on the 1° SO neither flips a single column at `η = ±0.1 … ±2 m` (`python_prototypes/mom6_zstar/mom6_zstar.py`), against `z_fixed`'s 12-356 and `zstar_full`'s 9-294; (2) at `η = 0`, `s == 1` and the target IS `z_fixed`'s bit for bit. So `zfixed_closed_faces` builds `z_fixed`'s mask, every consumer is reused, and the knob (or `&ocean_zinit_nml`) seeds `h_layer` on the `η = 0` target with I1′ established on the seeded fillers before the sponge snapshot. **`η < 0`:** a partial bed cell scales with `s` like every live layer, so it stays above `H_VANISHED` for every `s > H_VANISHED/p0` (`p0 > 1.5e-4 m` its `η = 0` thickness) — i.e. unless the column all but dries, which z\* does not support (`s` is floored at 0; wet/dry is refused). Refused under an ice-shelf cavity: MOM6's rigid-top (`z_rigid_top`) branch is not ported, so the fine levels would hang from the ice base. **Answer change:** every namelist and test that selected `"zstar"` ran sigma until this slice. Gates: `test_ocean_vcoord_interface_depths` (`zstar_eta0_is_z_fixed`, `zstar_dilates_profile_static_pattern`: interface depths = profile × `(H + η)/H` on flat, sloping and 1.2-mm-partial-cell columns, uniform and stretched profiles, `η` of both signs), `test_ocean_zstar_closed_faces` (mask = target liveness, static for `η` of either sign, and the resting 200 m / 30 m shelf break), `test_ocean_decomp_bitid_mpi :: file_readers_zstar`. **Open steps (closed faces off), the configuration MOM6 runs.** The FV-MOM6 in-situ PGF used to read the bed fillers' T/S at `h/H_VANISHED` of their value across every open step face, which put every `zstar` × `fv_mom6` × Wright/Roquet cell of the compat matrix 11-55× over its energy bound. That read is fixed (see the `z_fixed` refusal paragraph below). `sadourny_hk` runs its pair floor there (`coriolis_adv_t%hk_pair_floor`). `stress_tensor` is still a gap: its arithmetic corner thickness against the face divisor, MOM6's `hq` not ported, compat row `zstar_open_steps_stress_tensor`. None of the 16 shipped `zstar` namelists selects any of the three: they run `mont`/`fv_lite` on a linear EOS. **Open steps on realistic bathymetry are not yet safe:** a CLIFF (a few-metre column beside a deep one) carries a PGF error that MOM6 absorbs in its bottom-boundary-layer viscous coupling and roundabout does not, by default. See the `z_fixed` refusal paragraph below. Run real bathymetry with `zfixed_closed_faces = .true.`. **`zstar_full` is slated for retirement** once z\* is proven on the 1° Southern Ocean and the global case.

  **The knob OFF over a stepped bed is REFUSED at configure** (`refuse_open_zfixed_staircase`, the `zfixed_closed_faces = .false.` leg of `configure_ocean_closed_faces`). Wherever two wet columns' bed falls in DIFFERENT nominal `z_fixed` layers, an open face pairs a live layer with a bed filler, and the open-staircase pressure gradient above is not a slow drift — on the 1° Southern Ocean it is `u ≈ 250 m/s` by step 3 (4e9 m/s on the filler faces, `h → −2e9`, first non-finite in `post_bt`), with or without any closure. So `vcoord_type = "z_fixed"` with the knob off fails loud, naming the knob, the reason and the fix (`&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces = .true.`) and reporting how many stepped faces it found, through the `ierr` status path (the API returns `OCEAN_STATUS_ERR_SETUP`, no `error stop`). The count is over each rank's OWNED wet faces (land-masked `dy_cu`/`dx_cv > 0`, both columns wet) off the same ghost-filled `bt_H_ref`/`z_top` target the mask builder reads, summed over the compute communicator — a tile-seam step counts once and every rank takes the same decision. A flat or step-free bed (every column's bed in the same nominal layer, e.g. `topo_config = "flat"`, or a flat bed with a land island) is still ACCEPTED and untouched (nothing is written ⇒ bit-identical), and so is a flat bed under a sloping ice draft: only the BED side is counted (`cavity_sloping_lid_rest_zfixed.nml`, which documents the open ice-base staircase, keeps running). The knob's default is unchanged. Gate: `test_ocean_zfixed_closed_faces` (`open_staircase_stepped_bed_refused`, `open_staircase_flat_bed_accepted`, `closed_faces_stepped_bed_accepted`, `bed_step_count`). **Root cause (2026-10-04), and what the refusal now guards.** The blow-up was not the geometry of the open step. The FV-MOM6 PGF read a bed filler's T/S as `hS/max(h, H_VANISHED)`, i.e. `h/H_VANISHED` of the truth (2/3 at `zstar_h_min = 1e-4 m`). The cross-face Boole integral of the in-situ (Wright/Roquet) branch and the PLM/PPM stencil then carried that salinity over the live layer's thickness. At rest, a live|filler face read `2.9e-3 m/s²`. The PGF now reads the filler's I1′ donor concentration (Pass C of the FV-MOM6 kernels), giving `1.4e-6` (`test_ocean_pgf_insitu :: open_step_filler_faces_*`). With that alone, and the refusal bypassed for the measurement only, the open-staircase `z_fixed` cell of the compat-matrix domain runs 24 steps at `En = 6.47e-3` (closed faces `6.13e-3`, sigma `6.77e-3`; before: CFL panic at step 9). The 1-degree Southern Ocean with the knob off runs 12 steps at `En = 9.4e-4` (closed faces `8.1e-4`; before: `En 2.6e-2`, CFL 0.81 at step 2, the I1′ tripwire at step 3). The same read also bit the shipped closed-faces runs. `z_fixed`'s live/filler pattern is not static in η (12-356 flipped columns on the 1° SO, above), but the closed-face mask is. So after the first regrid a few OPEN faces meet a filler: 3 on the 1° SO at step 1. There the floored read gave `3-6e-5 m/s²` against `0.4-6e-6` now. That is a demonstrated bug-fix answer change for the `fv_mom6` + Wright closed-faces namelists: 1° SO `En` −0.28 % at day 10, global 1° −0.11 % at day 5. The 35 compare.py goldens are untouched, value for value, on CPU and GPU. **The refusal is still a safety fence.** A 10-year 1° Southern Ocean run with `zstar` and closed faces off (the full production physics: EPBL, kappa-shear, tidal mixing, GM + MEKE + VarMix, Redi, MLE, sponge, JRA55 wind, 50 tanh levels, `dt = 1800 s`) still died at step 13, through two more open-step defects:
(1) **Redi read a non-live layer's T/S as `hTr/max(h, H_DIV_EPS)`** (`H_DIV_EPS = 1e-20`). A thin partial bed cell, drained to `h = −8.2e-4 m` by the GM bolus flux (then folded into the same continuity sweeps as the resolved flux, so its availability cap bounded the stage-entry `h`; GM is now its own sequential operator on the current `h`, see below), read T as `c·h/1e-20`. Redi's Phase B (on the post-continuity `h`) then put 5e12 of content into it, the BT loop went non-finite one step later, and I1′ tripped. Fixed: Redi reads layer T/S by the I1′ column rule (`rdb_vl_column_conc`; gate `test_ocean_redi_zfixed :: open_steps_drained_cell_bounded`), bit-identical on the closed-faces runs.
(2) **Not fixed: open faces at CLIFFS carry an unabsorbed PGF error.** Where a few-metre z\* column abuts a deep one (a 10 m coastal cell beside 1600-3400 m on the 1° SO, rx0 ≈ 1), every face-layer below the shallow column's bed is a live|filler face. The FV PGF there integrates along a path spanning thousands of metres and errs by ~1e-3 m/s² at rest. MOM6 has the same PGF error, and absorbs it in `vertvisc_coef`/`find_coupling_coef`: those layers sit inside the face's bottom boundary layer (`z_clear`, harmonic `z_i`) and are glued with `Kv_bbl`. Roundabout's default momentum vdiff gives them the arithmetic face thickness and leaves them free. With Redi fixed, the 1° run survives, but at `En = 8.0e-3` by day 5, climbing (closed faces: `7.0e-4`). With `&ocean_vdiff_nml hvel_mom6 + bbl_glue` (MOM6's treatment, linear piston drag) it was `1.24e-3` at day 10 against closed `5.6e-4`, and `7.1e-4` vs `5.7e-4` with GM off. That GM factor was GM pouring deep water through the open steps into the fillers below the shallow columns' bed. Two GM changes (2026-10-05) remove it: GM is its own sequential operator on the CURRENT thickness, after the dynamics (MOM6 `thickness_diffuse`; alone it does not move the energy: `1.46e-3`), and MOM6's bottom-blocking (no transport from below the receiving column's bed): `6.93e-4` at day 10, GM-off level; closed faces unchanged at `5.60e-4`. Over one year (the same open-steps physics, glue and linear drag, GM on) the run is clean (budgets closed to `1e-14`) and its energy sits `1.24-1.45x` the closed-faces twin (`8.98e-4` vs `6.24e-4` at day 365; the production closed-faces baseline, quadratic drag, `6.20e-4`) — no longer GM's: GM-off is the same `1.27x` at day 10, so what is left is the cliff PGF above. Making the glue the default is an open decision.
Lifting the refusal waits on (2). Two further open-step gaps stay, independent of the PGF: the `stress_tensor` corner thickness (compat row `zstar_open_steps_stress_tensor`) and the FV-lite / FV-Wright `rho_0` filler substitution in their `rho_face·Δz_centre` term.

  **The composition rule, stated once:** the three face gates are independent and multiply — `dy_eff(I,j,k) = dy_cu(I,j) · por_face_area_u(I,j,k) · open_u(I,j,k)`, where `dy_cu` carries the 2-D LAND decision, `por_face_area_*` the continuous SUBGRID narrowing (Adcroft 2013), and `open_*` the per-LAYER z-level closure. Porous barriers and closed faces are **not** mutually exclusive. Consumers: the four continuity-PPM layer-flux sites and the barotropic renormaliser's per-layer weight `wk = dy_cu·por·open` (so `uhbt` is distributed over the OPEN layers only and `Σ_k mass_flux = uhbt` stays the exact fixed point); the transport-Coriolis mass fluxes; `mask_layer_velocities` after every stage (the "no normal velocity" half, run immediately after `apply_bt_correction` at all three call sites); the `&ocean_hdiff_nml kappa_h` lateral tracer flux; the HARMONIC velocity-Laplacian viscosity, where each neighbour difference is gated by the NEIGHBOUR face's open flag and the tendency by the face's own — without which the zeroed closed-face velocity acts as a Dirichlet-0, i.e. NO-slip drag, every step; the velocity BIHARMONIC — scalar `nu_4` and the flow-aware `nu4_face_*` of `smag_ah` / `leith_biharm` — under the same gate on every difference of BOTH chained Laplacians and the tendency gated by the face's own flag, so a closed face-layer is a free-slip (Neumann/mirror) boundary of the k⁴ operator exactly as a `wet_q` land corner is, and with a constant `nu_4` the operator stays negative semi-definite (until 2026-10-01 the flow-aware path ran UNGATED under this knob — it read the zeroed closed-face velocity as a Dirichlet value, i.e. no-slip drag at every staircase step, in the shipped 1° and 1/4° Southern Ocean and global 1° namelists — while `nu_4 > 0` was refused); the momentum vertical-friction tridiagonal, whose face column becomes `min(h_L,h_R)` and whose coupling across an interface touching a closed layer is CUT (the decoupling the tracer matrix has always had and the momentum one never did — see the "residual known weakness" note below, which this closes inside the knob); and the ALE face-velocity remap, whose source and target face columns become `min(h_L,h_R)` with the closed layers dropped, so momentum is neither poured into nor drained out of water that is not there. Tracer advection needs nothing: it rides `mass_flux_*_layer`, which the mask has already zeroed.

  **Fail-loud exclusions** (`configure_ocean_closed_faces`): any coordinate but `z_fixed` / `zstar` / `zstar_full`; an unresolved `z_fixed_h_ref` (`z_fixed`, `zstar`) or, under `zstar_full`, `zstar_h_surf_target <= 0` (no fillers to close); an empty `bt_H_ref`; `&ocean_wetdry_nml enable` (wet/dry moves the live/filler pattern and the mask is static); `&ocean_bt_nml bt_halo > 0` (the wide-halo BT clone carries no mask — the same argument `&ocean_porous_nml` makes) — the eddy closures are NOT excluded, all three compose (Fox-Kemper MLE is ported: the ML walk skips fillers and each face builds its overturning on its OPEN column, `H_vel` clamped to the open-column thickness so the cell still closes when the mixed layer is deeper than a shallow step, `uhml`/`vhml` exactly zero on every closed face-layer and filler — `test_ocean_mle_zfixed`; Redi is ported: each face pairs only its contiguous OPEN WINDOW — open at the face, live on both sides — so the neutral-surface sweep, the PPM reconstruction and the flux never touch a closed face-layer or a filler, `test_ocean_redi_zfixed`; GM is ported: it builds its streamfunction on each face's OPEN column, zero at the bottom and the top of it, and the slopes slot masks slope / N² to the open column on this path (its interface-tilt term differences geopotential heights, so the staircase bed is not read as a slope — `test_ocean_slopes_datum`) — `test_ocean_gm_zfixed`; MEKE, which sources from GM's `gm_src`, rides along); `&ocean_hvisc_nml stress_tensor`, and with it `kh_aniso`, which only that path reads (its T-cell tension and corner shear are masked by the 2-D `wet_*` fields only, so the zeroed closed-face velocity would enter the strain as a Dirichlet value; the velocity-Laplacian harmonic kernels and both biharmonic paths carry the free-slip gate); and the one barotropic path that still weights by the FULL column rather than the open one — `&ocean_bt_nml correction_bc_pgf` (`compute_pbce`, `compute_gtot_faces` and the bc-PGF `du_bc` block in `apply_bt_correction`: its depth-mean-zero identity holds on the full column, not on the open column `ubt` is the mean of). It is refused until it is ported to `h_face·open`, never left to run on the wrong column. `upstream_h_face`, `substep_drag` and `wave_drag` ARE ported: the upstream fast-loop face depth is the open upstream column (the full-column sum it used to take ran the 1-degree Southern Ocean to the `maxvel` clamp and NaN at step 309; ported, its 10-day `En` is `5.709E-04` against the knob-off `5.493E-04`), and both damping factors use the open-column face depth `Σ_k h_face·open` (gate: `tests/test_ocean_bt_upstream_zfixed.F90`). And, in `validate_config`, `split_scheme = "pred_corr"` with `&ocean_bc_nml mask_wall_velocity = .false.`: an unmasked solid-wall face moves no mass and has its depth mean reset by the BT fold every stage, but its BAROCLINIC layer velocity is never rotated by the `pred_corr` Coriolis — that reads `u_av`, and the renormaliser that writes `u_av` skips wall faces, so the wall face's `u_av` is its step-1 copy forever — and it integrates its interior neighbour's layer Coriolis (baroclinic because of the closed bed layer) without bound. Measured on the rotating ledge basin of `tests/test_ocean_zfixed_cor_ref.F90`: `KE+PE` ×1783 in 4000 steps with the interior faces at ×1.24; the default masked walls read ×0.74. This was the "second `pred_corr` × closed-faces × rotation amplifier" that test used to report — a property of the test's unmasked walls, not of the closed-face dynamics. Single-rank in the same sense the porous path is.

  **Barotropic consistency.** Closing a face removes transport CAPACITY from the column, not water, so the barotropic mode has to be told — in FIVE places, under the SAME weights, or they disagree about what `ubt` means and the disagreement compounds every step. (1) `derive_bt_from_layers` builds `ubt` as the OPEN-column depth mean `Σ h_face·open·u / Σ h_face·open`, because the fast loop transports on `ubt·FA·dy_cu_bt` with `dy_cu_bt` narrowed by the open fraction — `ubt` there already MEANS the open-column mean. (2) `face_depth_mean_u/v` and their `visc_rem` twins depth-average the slow tendencies into `F_bt` under the same weights (note a closed layer's `visc_rem` is ~1, not 0 — the closed-face vdiff decoupling leaves it uncoupled, so `visc_rem` alone does not stand in for the mask). (3) `apply_bt_correction` takes a third, OPEN-LAYER branch: a closed layer gets `wt = 0` and receives nothing **by construction**, where the spike added `Δu` uniformly and relied on `mask_layer_velocities` to take it back out — preservation by cancellation. The open layers get the uniform increment, or `visc_rem/⟨visc_rem⟩_h` over the open column under `correction_visc_rem`; the h-weighted form (now retired everywhere) was measured to put the sloping-lid case at `En = 2.1E-04` by day 1 and non-finite on day 2, because at a partially open face `h_o/h_bar_o` concentrates the whole increment into the thickest open layer. (4) `set_cor_ref_velocity` — the `pred_corr` fast-loop Coriolis reference (MOM6 `ubt_Cor`) — takes ITS depth mean of `u_av/v_av` under the same weights.  This one was MISSED for a release and is the reason `metrics` is now a REQUIRED argument of `derive_bt_from_layers`, `face_depth_mean_u/v` (+ the `visc_rem` twins) and `apply_bt_correction` rather than an optional one (a caller that wants the full-column branch passes a metrics object with `use_closed_faces = .false.`, never omits it): the call site omitted it, silently took the FULL-column branch, and returned `φ·ū_open` where the fast loop integrates its live Coriolis on `ū_open`. The un-cancelled `Δa_u = +f·(1−φ_v)·v̄` then forces EVERY barotropic substep *proportionally to the barotropic velocity itself* — an amplifier, not a seed, and on a partial-step face `φ` is O(0.5), not O(1 − 1e-4).  An optional argument that silently changes the physics is the defect CLASS, and removing the optionality is the fix for the class. (5) `dy_cu_bt`/`dx_cv_bt` carry `dy_cu·(Σ_k h_face·por·open)/(Σ_k h_face)`, recomputed from the LIVE `h` every outer step at the porous cadence (`closed_faces_update_bt_widths`, which SUPERSEDES the porous write rather than multiplying it — the combined thickness-weighted fraction already contains the porous one). `bt_H_ref` is deliberately untouched: it is the mass datum of the whole column, and a closed face removes transport capacity, not water. Gates: `test_ocean_zfixed_cor_ref` — which is where the Coriolis reference is pinned, because the two tests either side of it CANNOT see it (`test_ocean_cor_ref_seiche` is all-open, so `φ ≡ 1`; `test_ocean_zfixed_bt_seiche` runs at `f = 0`, and the residual carries a factor `f`) — asserting that `cor_ref_u` is the OPEN-column depth mean of `u_av` to a derived round-off bound (measured `1.1111E-02` correct against the full-column `1.0000E-02` on the same column) and that the `pred_corr` and `ssp_rk2` references leave the SAME barotropic forcing on an exactly barotropic open-column state (measured `2.500E-07 m/s²` of spurious acceleration before the fix, matching the derived `f·(1−φ)·V`, against a `5.7E-20` bound after); and `test_ocean_zfixed_bt_seiche` — a closed-basin seiche over a staircase bed, asserting `Σ_k h_face·open·u_k = (Σ_k h_face·open)·ubt_end` to a derived round-off bound (and asserting the spike's combination MISSES it by exactly `Δu·(Σ_closed h)/(Σ_k h)`), a closed face at exactly zero at the end of every step, no energy growth over 22 seiche periods, and the period within 1.3 % of `2L/√(gH_eff)`.

  Two further consequences worth naming. The ALE remap is the LAST velocity writer of the outer step and is a pure column operator, so `mask_layer_velocities` is re-asserted after it — "a closed face carries zero normal velocity" is an end-of-STEP statement, not end-of-stage. And the bc-PGF retro-correction (`&ocean_bt_nml correction_bc_pgf`) is depth-mean-zero over the FULL column by construction, not over the open one, so under this knob it would push a barotropic increment into the open layers that only a cancellation against `mask_layer_velocities` hides — it is therefore REFUSED at configure (see the fail-loud list above), as are `substep_drag` and `wave_drag`, rather than preserved by cancellation.

  **What it buys, measured** (gfortran 15.1 Release, `pred_corr`, single rank). `cavity_flat_lid_rest_zfixed.nml` stays **`En = 0.000E+00` at every daily sample to 30 days** with the knob ON — the bit-zero gate is preserved exactly. `cavity_sloping_lid_rest_zfixed.nml`, which NaNs during day 18 without it, **completes 30 days**: `En` → **2.375E-06 (d 30)**, `MaxCFL ≤ 0.0037`, zero `nan-catch`, budgets `−6.1E-13 / −5.9E-13 / −6.2E-13`. The ISOMIP+ ice-free control (`isomip_plus/ocean0_ice_free_zfixed.nml`, promoted to the stability suite) **saturates** at `En = 1.006E-08` by day 2 (1.000E-08 at day 1.75) against 5.629E-04 with the knob off and still climbing — **56 000×** — with `MaxCFL` 0.0008 vs 0.086. The ISOMIP+ **cavity** under `z_fixed`, which goes non-finite during day 3 without the knob, reaches day 2 at `En = 8.842E-09`, `MaxCFL 0.00055` (max|u| ≈ 3.7 mm/s, against the throwaway spike's 0.26 m/s at the calving front), budgets `−3.8E-14 / 3.3E-14 / 4.9E-13`, and runs on to day 4 at `1.217E-08`. The barotropic slice is most of that: with the face mask but the OLD full-column barotropic weighting the same three cases sat at 2.102E-06 (30 d), 2.700E-06 (2 d, still climbing) and 8.011E-06 (2 d, NaN on day 3).

  **Closing faces removes the catastrophic, geometric part of the defect; it does not give a resting state.** What survives is the classical partial-step PGF error at an OPEN face between a PARTIAL and a FULL cell, which is Yung et al. (2026) §3.2 and is a separate slice. Do not read the sloping-lid number as "z_fixed is now at rest": the σ twin sits at `3.04E-08` at day 30, ~70× below it.

  **`z_fixed` × cavity — the shared first-live-layer index `k_top`, and what it unblocked** (P6.3/P6.4, 2026-09-21; `k_top ≡ nz` off a rigid top ⇒ bit-identical everywhere else). On an ice-covered column under a quasi-geopotential coordinate `k = nz` is an inert filler, not the ice-adjacent live layer — a state no consumer in the tree had ever seen. `multilayer_state_t%k_top(i,j)` is the index of the shallowest LIVE layer (the largest `k` with `h > H_VANISHED`, strict `>`, matching the remap drain's `H_FLOOR` and the melt sampler's own gate), with its two face twins `k_top_u`/`k_top_v` = **`min`** of the two bounding columns — a face carries water in layer `k` only where BOTH sides do, which is exactly what `metrics%open_u/open_v` says, so the face's shallowest live layer is the DEEPER of the two column tops. It falls back to `nz` on a column with no top-side filler and on a dead/land column, which is what makes routing every consumer through it bit-identical on sigma, z*-lite and every family shipped today. It is **static**: filled once at configure by `configure_ocean_k_top` from `ocean_vcoord_z_fixed_target` at `η = 0` — the same kernel and the same `bt_H_ref`/`z_top` the closed-face mask is built from, so there is ONE definition of "live" in the tree (`test_ocean_ktop` asserts the two agree face for face) — and under `z_fixed` `η` is absorbed by the first live layer while a filler's target is `zstar_h_min` whatever `η` does, so the pattern cannot move. Producer: the `pure` `ocean_vcoord_k_top_from_target`. Unit gates: `test_ocean_ktop` (5 cases) and `test_ocean_ktop_consumers` (6 cases, every one the same physical column with and without three fillers on top).

  **Routed through it** — the melt heat/salt deposit and its budget mirror (`apply_surface_src_2d_impl` and its three twins: the cavity's `heat_cavity`/`salt_cavity` pass through `ocean_surface_flux_assemble` UNMASKED, so this was the load-bearing site), the `freshwater="mass"` column source and its pseudo-salt mirror, the ice-shelf top drag (band walk started at `k_top_u/v`, band gate raised from `h_face <= 0` to `<= H_VANISHED` so a filler can no longer take a full drag rate on a massless layer, and the implicit-fold rate captured on the row the vdiff diagonal adds it to), `top_drag_stress_mag_impl` — hence `stress_shelf`, hence the under-ice `u_*` BOTH boundary-layer schemes read — the momentum vertical-friction surface row plus the top-drag and wind-stress folds in `diffuse_velocity_columns_impl` (with the rows above `k_top` written as the identity, which also removes the `1/h` `b_diag` spike the previous envelope carried as a known weakness), and the `mld_density` diagnostic. **Already inert, verified not routed**: everything the binary cover mask zeroes at source on a covered column — wind stress (explicit and the `hmix` band; `tau` is zeroed face-for-face by `ocean_surface_stress_apply_cover`), the shortwave deposit (`i0col ∝ (1 − cover)`), both restoring increments, and the SST read in the flux assembler (`massout ∝ (1 − cover)`) — plus the `volume_compensation` sink and its passive-tracer rescale, whose own gate is `cover_frac < 0.5`, and an open-ocean column has `z_top = 0` ⇒ `k_top ≡ nz`. **Filler T/S is never read as an ocean property**: the substitution happens at CONSUMPTION (the melt far-field sampler already `cycle`s a vanished layer; the linear EOS substitutes `(T_ref, S_ref)` below the marker) and nothing is written into the fillers.

  **The payoff, measured.** `validation_examples/ocean/isomip_plus/ocean0_idealised_zfixed.nml` — ISOMIP+ Ocean0 idealised on `z_fixed` + `zfixed_closed_faces` with basal melt AND ice-shelf top drag ON, `h_min_cavity = 40 m` — **runs the full 30 days**, in 185 s on one V100 (6.2 s/simulated day; measured on the v0.1.0 defaults — `bebt = 0.1`, `renorm_consistent_flux`, the I1′ vanished-layer rule), zero `nan-catch`, zero CFL truncations, `MaxCFL ≤ 0.061`, budgets linear at round-off (`−5.8E-13 / 1.36E-12 / 1.48E-12` mass/salt/heat at d30). `En` runs `7.755E-08` (d1) → `3.104E-05` (d10) → `2.304E-04` (d30) with `max|u| ≈ 25 cm/s`; the cavity-mean melt rate runs `3.78 → 5.70 → 5.62 m/yr` (d1/d10/d30) with a maximum of `29.1 m/yr` and refreezing (down to `−0.21 m/yr`) appearing from day 18. That energy is the melt-driven circulation, not the coordinate's own noise: the melt-OFF twin sits at `En = 5.6E-08` at day 30 (~4100× under it) and saturates near `3.5E-06` by day ~165 (the baseline below), still ~60× under it. The σ twin of the same case — same namelist, `vcoord_type = "sigma"`, `zfixed_closed_faces` off (it is refused on σ), `h_min_cavity = 20` — **does not survive**: the barotropic loop blows up on day 15.9 (outer step 4591, 5358 non-finite BT-correction faces). That contrast is the coordinate's whole case.

  **`z_fixed` bed side — the first-live-layer index `k_bot`** (2026-10-01; `k_bot ≡ 1` off `z_fixed` ⇒ bit-identical everywhere else, goldens 35/35 CPU + GPU). Every `z_fixed` column shallower than the nominal stack carries inert fillers BELOW its partial bed cell — 27 338 of 37 698 columns (73 %) on the 1° Southern Ocean cut, `k_bot` up to 47 of 50 — so `k = 1` is not the bed-adjacent layer. `multilayer_state_t%k_bot(i,j)` is the smallest `k` with `h > H_VANISHED` on the `η = 0` target (fallback `1`), with `max`-rule face twins `k_bot_u/v` (the SHALLOWER bottom: a face carries water in `k` only where both columns do), built by `configure_ocean_k_bot` on EVERY `z_fixed` run (not only under a cavity) and face-halo-exchanged. **Routed through it**: bottom drag (bed-only rows, HBBL walk start + `bed_factor`, the implicit-fold rate `lambda_bot_u/v`), the vdiff momentum bed row (no-flux BC, the `implicit_drag` diagonal, the `bbl_glue` piston and height-above-bed stack; rows below are the identity), geothermal (scan start — it was already correct through its `h > 1e-3` scan), the tidal-mixing bed anchor (`N_bot` for `e_compute`, TKE sweep, bed-layer exclusion and end-cap — `N_bot` was read across two fillers carrying the same donor T/S, i.e. ZERO, so `e_compute` mixed nothing on every filler column), MEKE's bed speed (it read the closed-face zero), the bed-reaching shortwave residual + EPBL's SW ledger, and the BT budget probe. **Measured, 1° Southern Ocean, 10 days, day-10 `En` (main → k_bot)**: `implicit_drag`, `hbbl = 0` — `5.586E-04` → `5.415E-04` (on main it was bit-for-bit the explicit bed-only run, and that differs from a NO-drag run only in the 4th digit: the fold landed on a row the vdiff cut, so it never reached water); explicit bed-only `5.586E-04` → `5.418E-04`; the shipped HBBL = 10 m drag `5.493E-04` → `5.363E-04` (the band used to start at `k = 1` and spend itself on fillers and on the closed half-cell of every staircase face); `bdrag implicit` + HBBL `5.494E-04` → `5.365E-04`; the visc_rem chain (`correction_h_weighted` + `correction_visc_rem` + `implicit_drag`, `hbbl = 0`) `4.416E-03` → `4.154E-03` — still 8× the base run: that growth belongs to `correction_h_weighted` and is NOT fixed here. Budgets unchanged at round-off. **Not routed** (status, not oversights): kappa-shear's JHL08 column solve (sees a spurious shear at the live/filler interface; the Kd it puts there is cut by the tracer vdiff, but its TKE iteration is not filler-aware — wants the compacted column), and `implicit_drag` + `hbbl > 0`, still refused (the fold is ONE 2-D rate on the bed-row diagonal; a band needs a per-layer `lambda_bot`). Gate: `tests/test_ocean_zfixed_k_bot.F90`.

  **And the budget caveat, stated plainly.** Through **day 15** all three console residuals grow LINEARLY with step count at ~`2E-14`/day — round-off accumulation, the gate this slice owed. At day 16 the salt and heat residuals jump four decades and change sign, reaching `−5.5E-08` / `8.0E-08` relative by day 30. That is still only `2E-05` of the tracked melt source and nothing like the per-step loss of the whole deposit the pre-`k_top` refusal named — but it is not round-off, and it was **not isolated**. The leading suspect is the BED side, which Phase 6 scoped out on purpose: `k_bot` was deliberately not shipped, the partial BOTTOM cell absorbs `η` plus the bed fillers' debt, and the closed-faces census measured the thinnest live layer on this geometry at **1.8 mm** — once the flow is energetic enough to move it through `H_VANISHED` the ALE remap drain empties it un-budgeted. Do not quote this case's budgets as closed past day 15.

  **Refusals lifted, and the ones that stay.** `&ocean_cavity_melt_nml enable` and `&ocean_tdrag_nml enable` are now ACCEPTED under `z_fixed` × cavity. `&ocean_hdiff_nml kappa_h /= 0` is accepted **iff `&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces = .true.`**: the face mask already multiplies every hdiff face flux by `open_u`/`open_v`, which is exactly zero wherever the layer is a filler on either side, so a filler cell has all four own-layer faces closed, its divergence is identically zero and the garbage concentration the module's `h > 0` gate computes for it never leaves the cell — flux-zero, conservative by construction, and a strictly stronger statement than the `H_VANISHED` threshold P6.5 proposed, because it also closes the partial⇄filler face the threshold would leave open on the thick side. With the mask OFF the refusal stands verbatim. **Still refused**: `&ocean_vmix_nml use_kpp`, `&ocean_epbl_nml enable`, `&ocean_tracers_nml enable_ideal_age`, `&ocean_gm_nml enable`, `&ocean_redi_nml`/`&ocean_slopes_nml enable`, `&vcoord_nml regrid_time_scale > 0`, and — NEW, found in the P6.4 survey and previously unfenced — `&ocean_kappa_shear_nml enable` (its JHL08 column solve closes its surface row on `k = nz`; a column solver wants the compacted column `rdb_massless` builds, not an index) and `&ocean_tidal_mixing_nml enable` (the `N²` column halves the `k = nz−1` interface spacing against a filler). `h_min_cavity ≥ 2·h_nominal` is still required (ISOMIP+ §3.1.5), and still MOVES the grounding line relative to a σ leg. The varying-draft WARNING is unchanged.

  **The `z_fixed` × cavity envelope for v0.1.0 (gate E6).** Two further rules, both from the melt-OFF baseline below. **REFUSED:** `&ocean_pgf_nml reconstruct_for_pressure = .true.` — the in-layer PLM/PPM T/S edge build reads the layer means of the inert top-side fillers as neighbouring water and poisons the partial top cell's edge values; ISOMIP+ Ocean0 melt-off, from rest, spins up `En = 3.4E-04 m²/s²` in the first 3 hours and holds `~1E-03` (MaxCFL up to 0.85) for 30 days — ~19 000× the layer-mean-density run and ~5× the melt-ON circulation (before I1′ and `bebt = 0.1` it went non-finite at day 0.41). Refused until the filler-aware reconstruction lands; the layer-mean (PCM) density is unaffected and is what every shipped namelist runs. **WARNED (never refused):** `&ocean_hvisc_nml nu_h < 2 m²/s` (`ZFIXED_CAVITY_NU_H_MIN`). With `nu_h = 0` Ocean0 carries an inviscid mode growing EXPONENTIALLY at `0.18 /day` (d15–30) and accelerating (`0.14 → 0.22 /day`, d15–20 → d25–30; `En(30 d) = 1.44E-06`, 26× the protocol leg); `nu_h = 2` already decelerates (`0.092 → 0.068 /day`, `1.12E-07`); the bracket below 2 was not refined. The vcoord stability matrix runs this combination inviscid on purpose, which is why it is a warning. Flow-aware closures do not stand in for it at these speeds (Smagorinsky adds `(C_s·Δx)²|D| ≈ 1 m²/s`; the Smagorinsky-on protocol leg is the base to every printed digit). Gates: `test_ocean_vcoord_hygiene` (`z_fixed_cavity_refuses_pgf_reconstruct`, with the same knob accepted on a σ cavity; `z_fixed_cavity_low_nu_h_warns_not_refuses`, which captures the warning through the logger's file sink and asserts the configuration still validates).

  **The melt-OFF baseline, measured to 180 days — bounded and explained, not at rest.** `ocean0_idealised_zfixed.nml` with melt and top drag off (`nu_h = 6`, `kappa_h = 0`, `pred_corr`, `dt = 300 s`) is NOT a resting state, and it carries no unbounded mode. The energies below are re-measured on the v0.1.0 defaults (`bebt = 0.1`, `renorm_consistent_flux`, I1′; V100, 2026-09-24); the mechanism diagnostics (the density-anomaly profiles, the unstratified and `κ_v = 0` controls, the exonerating twins) are §Q's, measured before those defaults. Two regimes. **(1) Day 0 to ~100, physical.** ISOMIP+ prescribes `κ_v = 5E-05 m²/s` against INSULATING boundaries (bed, ice base with melt off, open surface); a linear `ρ(z)` is not a steady state there — the boundary cell accumulates the flux it cannot pass on, `ρ′ ≈ κ(dρ/dz)t/h` while `t ≪ h²/κ`, then `∝ √(κt)` (predicted `2.8E-03 / 8.3E-03 / 1.4E-02 kg m⁻³` at d15/45/75 in the 20 m bed cells, measured `2.6E-03 / 6.9E-03 / 1.0E-02`). Where the boundary is SLOPED — the trough sidewalls and the tilted ice base — that anomaly sits at a different `z` in neighbouring columns and drives an along-slope geostrophic current of 2–10 mm/s (Phillips 1970; Wunsch 1970). `En ∝ t²→t`: `6.8E-09` (d1), `5.6E-08` (d30), `2.2E-07` (d90), the 5-day log-rate falling from `0.073` (d5–10) to `0.012 /day` (d85–90). With `dT/dz = dS/dz = 0` the same geometry holds `En(30 d) = 4.1E-20`, and `pp81_kappa_bg = 0` removes 5/6 of the day-30 energy — protocol physics, present in any model that runs Ocean0 with `κ_v ≠ 0` from a linear profile. **(2) Day ~105 to ~165, numerical.** One row of 7.3 m partial top cells at the calving front (the western neighbour's 1.9 m cut fell under the `0.1·h_nominal` sliver rule and was merged down, so each pocket has a closed west face, an open east face and a full cell below) accumulates a tracer error — `T` and `S` decouple in a cell with no diffusion and a linear EOS, which names the transport chain, not the physics — and grows a ONE-CELL jet along the front (`Re_Δ ≈ 7`) on a 15–18-day e-folding that **saturates** by day ~165 (`2.26E-06` d150, peak `3.80E-06` d173.5, `3.15E-06` d180; max|u| ≈ 2 cm/s, `MaxCFL < 0.01`, budgets `≤ 9E-12` over the 180 days; the `kappa_h = 1` twin peaks at `3.72E-06` on d162.5 and ends at `2.77E-06`). Exonerated by 180-day twins: the remap weights (`remap_nonuniform_weights`), `bebt = 0.2`, the donor-flip renormalisation fix, `kappa_h = 1`, `κ_v = 0`, Smagorinsky, and `dt`/`n_inner`/`ssp_rk2` at 30 days. Its removal at the source is v0.2. **Read the melt-ON energy against `~3.5E-06`, not against zero** — the melt-driven circulation sits ~60× above it. **The viscosity envelope on this 2 km grid:** `nu_h ≥ 2` REQUIRED (the inviscid mode above); `nu_h ≥ 30` removes the calving-front jet outright (its viscous decay `ν/Δx² ≈ 0.65 /day` beats the jet's `~0.2 /day` generation; the run stays on the regime-1 power law, `2.12E-07` at d180, `En ∝ t^0.9`); the ISOMIP+ Table-4 value `6`, shipped, keeps the jet, saturated. Measured in `python_prototypes/design/cavity_rest_growth_diagnosis.md` §Q; gated as the tier-1 (local, GPU, ~18 min per leg) stability rows `isomip_plus_ocean0_zfixed_meltoff` (`En(30 d) < 1E-07`, the d25–30 log-rate below the d15–20 one, `En(180 d) < 1E-05`, `En(180)/En(150) < 2`) and `isomip_plus_ocean0_zfixed_meltoff_nu30` (peak `En < 5E-07`).
  **The same term over a RESOLVED bed is far larger, and it is fatal — the σ stiffness limit.** `Δe` in `N²Δe³/(6·dx·H̄)` is the offset between two columns' `K`-th interfaces, and under σ that offset is set by whichever boundary tilts *more*. On the three `ice_shelf_cavity/` files the bed is flat and the lid step is 13.8 m; on `validation_examples/ocean/isomip_plus/ocean0_idealised_draft.nml` the ISOMIP+ channel-wall term (their Eq. 4) drops the **bed** 122 m across one 2 km cell — a 23.1 m water column beside a 145.5 m one, stiffness `rx0 = |ΔH|/(H_a+H_b) = 0.726`, **3.6× the classical Beckmann & Haidvogel (1993) / Haney (1991) bound of 0.2**, with 168 wet-wet faces over it. Cubed, that is `a_peak = 1.48E-05 m s⁻²` against the sloping lid's `3.73E-09` — **3 958×** — and `U = a/|f| = 10.5 cm s⁻¹` of spurious geostrophic flow seeded at one row of cells. The consequence is not a slow drift: that case runs clean for three days, then drives the barotropic `η` to −36.8 m in a ≤ 23 m column and produces a **negative `h_layer`** at outer step 910 (the fail-loud that fires is the melt driver's non-finite guard, which is the detector, not the site). Substitution says the same thing the `ice_shelf_cavity` set does — uniform density is machine zero (`8.5E-22` for 7 days) on the identical geometry, `nz = 12/18/36/72` all fail within 0.2 day of each other, and a FLAT lid over the same bed still fails — and every palliative only postpones (`h_min_cavity` 25/30/50 m → day 7.6/11.2/19.8; `nu_h` 20/60 → day 14.2/25.2; only `nu_h = 600`, 100× the ISOMIP+ value, and `dt = 75 s` reach 30 days, both by letting the mode SATURATE at `1.4E-04`/`9.4E-04` rather than by removing it). **So: a quiescent or long σ integration over resolved slope, shelf break or trough wall measures this truncation, not the physics, and there is no knob that fixes it** — Phase 6 is the fix. `ocean_stability_audit` now WARNS at configure with the computed `rx0`, its two column thicknesses and its `(i,j)`; the full write-up is `design/cavity_rest_growth_diagnosis.md` §"ISOMIP+ Ocean0 idealised: day-3 blow-up" in the prototypes repo.

  **The `ρ̂`-vs-`ρ₀` load approximation, stated rather than hidden.** `ρ₀·g·z_draft` is the displaced weight at the REFERENCE density; a stratified column's true overburden `g∫ρ̂` differs by `−g∫(ρ̂ − ρ₀)`, whose gradient is a **depth-uniform** `N²·z_draft·∇z_draft` residual in the raw PGF — measured at `5.81e-6 m/s²` (vs `1.96e-2 = g·s` with the load off entirely). It is chosen because it is what ISOMIP+ prescribes and it cancels bit-exactly against the datum in a uniform-density column. Being depth-uniform, it is a bottom-pressure gradient: under the default split (`&ocean_bt_nml bc_pgf_forcing`) the barotropic mode adjusts to it (a surface tilt `N²·z_draft·s/g`, 4.5e-4 m/s of transient on the `test_ocean_cavity_load` case), where the legacy split annihilated it. `&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml trim_ic_for_p_surf` (MOM6 `TRIM_IC_FOR_P_SURF`, default off) starts balanced: the load is kept and each loaded column's initial top moves to where the stratified water above it weighs the load (`η = z_draft − s`, −3 mm to −4.8 cm under ISOMIP+ COLD), taking the depth-mean face force on `cavity_sloping_lid_rest` from `1.6e-5` to `3.9e-8 m/s²` (the residual is truncation) and its day-1 En from `1.06e-6` to `1.1e-9`. Closed form, so **linear EOS + `&ocean_zinit_nml source="linear"` only** (fails loud otherwise); a nonlinear-EOS / file-profile trim (MOM6 `cut_off_column_top`) is not wired. `draft_source="in_situ"` (the true isostatic solve) is deferred and fails loud.
  **Envelope**, each refused fail-loud: `&ocean_pgf_nml form="fv_mom6"` + `gfs_scale = 1`; `vcoord_type` ∈ {sigma, z_fixed} (`zstar` was accepted while it was the sigma branch; as MOM6 z\* it is refused — no rigid-top branch) and `thickness_config /= "uniform_z"` (every z-like family anchors its target interfaces at `z = 0`, which under a shelf is inside the ice); the split solver (`n_inner ≥ 1`); single rank; `bt_halo = 0` (and in `bt_halo_auto_exclusion`, so AUTO resolves to 0 rather than manufacturing a width that then aborts); mutually exclusive with wet/dry, porous barriers, sea ice and `&ocean_tides_nml use_sal`. `&ocean_zinit_nml enable` **composes** (the refusal was lifted with P5.3): the overlay now measures each layer centre's depth from `z = 0` rather than from the column top, so a geopotential `T(z)`/`S(z)` lands at the right depth under a draft instead of `z_draft` metres too shallow. Without `&ocean_psurf_nml in_eos` configure WARNS that the in-situ EOS still ignores the load.
- **Ice-shelf basal melt** (`&ocean_cavity_melt_nml enable`, default off ⇒ byte-identical) — the Holland & Jenkins (1999) three-equation interface, solved once per thermo step on every ice-covered column and delivered to the ocean as two OWNED surface-flux components, `heat_cavity = −q_ocean` (W/m², positive down, so warm water under a shelf COOLS the top of the column) and `salt_cavity = −m_mass·(S_far − s_ice)`. Requires `&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml` (the draft and the datum), `&ocean_eos_nml tfreeze_set="isomip"` (the sea-ice liquidus is ~0.03 °C away, enough to flip the SIGN of melt over a 0.03 °C band) and `&ocean_forcing_nml enable_components`. The far field is sampled over `far_field_depth` **METRES** below the ice base, thickness-weighted with a partial last layer — never "layer `nz`", because the sampling distance is the dominant resolution artefact in the subject and "layer nz" would make the melt rate a function of the vertical coordinate's cell thickness. The liquidus is evaluated at `multilayer_state_t%p_top` = `p_ice_ref + sf%p_surf`, the one interface pressure the FV-MOM6 surface BC and the in-situ EOS also read — the melt path is a pure consumer of it and writes nothing, asserting instead that the load was assembled. `&ocean_psurf_nml` therefore composes freely. Per-column solver status is reduced on device: a non-finite covered column is FATAL, while a non-converged or unbracketed one is counted, warned and given the kernel's zero-melt safe state. Tests: `test_ocean_cavity_flux` (coupling), `test_ocean_cavity_melt` (kernel, against a 17-digit oracle).

- **Ice-cover mask on the atmospheric forcing** (no knob of its own — it follows `&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml enable`; cavity off ⇒ byte-identical). Under `cover_frac = 1` there is no atmosphere, so every atmospheric term is multiplied by the open-water factor `1 − cover_frac` and the cavity's own `heat_cavity`/`salt_cavity` are **not**. Three places, chosen for what each one's consumers read:
  - **The wind-stress pair, once, at configure** (`ocean_surface_stress_apply_cover`, called from `configure_ocean_cavity` after the cover is built and before `enter_data`). `tau_x`/`tau_y` have three independent consumers — the explicit momentum source, the implicit vdiff stress fold (`tau_u=ss%tau_x`, into a hot tridiagonal kernel) and the MLE front-stress sampler — so the mask is applied to the SOURCE, not to each derived view, and the same call refreshes `stress_mag` (KPP/EPBL `u*` ⇒ exactly zero under cover). **Face rule:** a face is closed when EITHER adjacent cell is covered (`1 − max(cover_L, cover_R)`), the only choice that leaves no wind acting on a covered cell; the price is a one-face transition where the first OPEN cell at the front keeps one live face and so reads half the open-ocean `|tau|` — the `u*` consistent with the momentum it actually received.
  - **The surface-flux assembler** (`ocean_surface_flux_assemble`'s optional `cover_frac`) for `Q_heat_const`/`Q_salt_const`, `q_sw`/`q_lw`/`q_lat`/`q_sens`/`heat_added`, both mass-enthalpy terms and `salt_flux`. **Not at apply time** — deliberately: `Q_heat`/`Q_salt` are what KPP and EPBL read to build `B_0`, so masking later would leave both boundary-layer schemes forced by an atmosphere that is not there; and the assembler is the last place the atmospheric bands are still separable from `heat_cavity`/`salt_cavity`. With the component set off there is no assembler, so the static scalar fill is masked once at configure (`ocean_surface_flux_apply_cover_const`).
  - **Shortwave penetration and surface restoring** carry the factor themselves (optional `cover_frac`), because neither routes through `Q_heat`/`Q_salt`: SW reads the pristine `q_sw` component on the `sw_source="q_sw"` branch and, on either branch, would otherwise *move* a surface lump the masked deposit never added; restoring forms its flux in-kernel from the live SST/SSS.

  Every path is an OPTIONAL argument — absent ⇒ the original kernel, byte-identical — and every mask is idempotent. Tests: `cavity_cover_*` in `test_ocean_cavity_flux`.

  **Limitations you must read before quoting a number.**
  - **The meltwater's MASS is now optional, and the default is still VIRTUAL.** `&ocean_cavity_melt_nml freshwater="virtual"` (default, bit-identical) adds no volume and no direct buoyancy — only the salinity signature of dilution, exactly `−m_mass·(S_far − s_ice)`, the fixed-mass equivalent of adding mass at `s_ice`. For a cavity the meltwater volume/buoyancy *is* the circulation, so that remains a **first-order** limitation of the default, and configure still warns on every virtual run.
    `freshwater="mass"` lifts it: `dh = m·dt/ρ₀` is added to the top layer (Boussinesq, so `ρ₀` and not the freshwater density — the model's mass total is `ρ·volume` by construction), `d(hS) = dh·s_ice`, `d(hT) = dh·T_b`, and the salinity falls by dilution on its own, following the closed form `S(t) = S₀h₀/(h₀ + m t/ρ₀)`. The virtual flux is then NOT applied to the tracer (that would double-count) but IS still assembled into `Q_salt`, because it is the dominant part of the surface buoyancy flux KPP and EPBL build `B_0` from — `β·Q_salt/ρ₀` is about 6× `α·Q_heat/(ρ₀c_p)` at cavity temperatures — and removing it from `Q_salt` would leave both schemes blind to the freshening. `ocean_cavity_mass_step` takes it back out of salinity (and out of the pseudo-salt mirror) in the same stage, as the exact negation of the stamp the apply kernel made. Mass becomes a TRACKED budget source (`ms%mass_src`, printed as the console's `src` on the `Mass` line), so all three residuals still sit at round-off at every step. **What is still virtual:** sea ice, and the seven atmospheric/river mass-flux components of the surface-flux set. **Refused rather than half-wired:** dynamic wet/dry, and `dt_tracer_advect_ratio > 1`.
  - **Real mass raises sea level in a closed domain.** The ice draft is PRESCRIBED and static, so a rising `η` under a fixed draft does not lift the ice; the volume must leave through an open boundary or raise the open ocean's surface. For an ISOMIP+ Ocean0 box — ~30 m/yr of melt over ~1e10 m² of shelf into ~4e10 m² of open surface — that is metres per year, and Ocean0-2's only seam is a restoring band that moves no volume. `volume_compensation="uniform_open_ocean"` (requires `freshwater="mass"`) removes the domain-integrated melt volume again each thermo step, uniformly per unit area over the uncovered wet cells, each parcel carrying that cell's own `T` and `S` so no concentration changes, and tracked as a sink in all three budgets. ISOMIP+ Sect. 3.1.3 leaves the restored configurations uncompensated and allows compensation for the closed Ocean3/4; the default here is `"none"`, i.e. the protocol's position, with the knob available for a closed box.
  - The consistent virtual HEAT flux would also carry `−m·c_w·(T_w − T_b)`; it is dropped from the VIRTUAL form, deliberately, because `T_w − T_b` is hundredths of a degree and the term is `m/(ρ_w·γ_T) ≈ 0.1 %` of `q_ocean` — whereas its salt twin is `≈ 34 g/kg` and is the whole signal. The asymmetry is physical, and the mass form closes it: there the dilution of `T` happens through the growing `h`, exactly, and the two forms differ by precisely `−eps·(A + T₀ − T_b)/(1 + eps)` with `eps = m·dt/(ρ₀h₀)` (asserted, not approximated, in `test_ocean_cavity_freshwater`).
  - **Top drag now ships, but it is a separate opt-in** (`&ocean_tdrag_nml enable`, below). With it OFF, `cdrag_top` still scales the melt `u*` only and the ice base exerts no momentum stress, so the boundary-layer velocity under the shelf is the resolved interior flow, not a drag-limited one. With it ON, the two share ONE `C_d` and a disagreement is a fail-loud configure error.
  - **KPP and EPBL feel the ice** (Phase 4b). Both take `u_*² = (stress_mag + stress_shelf)/ρ₀`. `stress_mag` is still `|τ|` and nothing but `|τ|` — purely derived from the wind/sea-ice stress pair, and driven to **exactly zero** under a shelf by the cover mask. `stress_shelf` is the second term: the cell-centred ice-shelf base stress, `ocean_surface_stress_t%stress_shelf`, always allocated and **exactly zero without a cavity** (so every existing configuration is bit-identical). Its supports are disjoint from `stress_mag`'s — the cover mask zeroes `τ` wherever `cover_frac = 1`, and `stress_top` is multiplied by `cover_frac` — so the sum is the total upper-boundary momentum flux, not a double count, and it generalises unchanged to a fractional cover because each term already carries its own area weight. Kept a SEPARATE field rather than blended into `stress_mag` because every `τ` writer rebuilds `stress_mag` from scratch (a fold would be wiped at the next data-forcing bracket) and because the top-drag stress is recomputed every RK2 stage while the `τ` refresh is per outer step. **Who fills it, and the one lag:** with `&ocean_tdrag_nml` on, the RK2 stage drivers copy `top_drag%stress_top` into it INLINE, in the same stage that computes it and strictly before `vmix_apply_in_stage` reads it — no lag. With the top drag OFF but `&ocean_cavity_melt_nml` on, `engine_step_finalize` fills it from `ρ₀·u_*²` using the melt slot's own `u_*` — the SAME `C_d` under the one-drag-coefficient rule — but that runs at thermo cadence at the END of the step, so **that** path reaches the boundary-layer schemes one outer step late. Tests: `test_ocean_bl_under_ice`.
  - **KPP's boundary-layer depth does not respond to a STABILISING surface buoyancy flux** — a property of the scheme, stated here because basal melt produces exactly that (`B_0 > 0`: the freshening beats the cooling). This is the Large et al. (1994) bulk-Richardson depth, in which `B_0` is consumed only through `destabilizing = (B_0 < 0)` and `w_*³ = max(0, −B_0)·h_b`; for any `B_0 ≥ 0` all uses are identical to `B_0 = 0`. So KPP shoals under melt over TIME, through the stratification the meltwater builds, not instantaneously through `B_0`. EPBL has no such gap — its `cTKE` ledger charges both signs, and a stabilising flux shoals its boundary layer within the call. A Monin-Obukhov / Ekman stable-depth limiter for KPP (MOM6 carries one; this port does not) is the follow-up. Pinned by `test_ocean_bl_under_ice`'s `kpp_bl_is_insensitive_to_a_stabilising_b0`.
  - **The boundary layer's α and β are now selectable, and the default is still the CONSTANT pair** (`&ocean_vmix_nml buoyancy_coeffs`, E4). KPP's `B_0` and the double-diffusion density ratio historically used the scalar `&ocean_ic_nml alpha_T`/`beta_S` whatever the active EOS. Under `eos="linear"` — which is what ISOMIP+ prescribes, and what every shipped cavity namelist uses — those ARE the exact coefficients and nothing was ever wrong. Under Wright or Roquet they were not: measured, `α(−1.9 °C, 34.5, surface) = 2.62e-2` kg/m³/°C against `1.71e-1` at 10 °C — a factor **6.5** — rising to `5.87e-2` by 1000 dbar (**2.2×** over the same cold state). `buoyancy_coeffs="eos"` takes both from the active EOS instead, per column for `B_0` (at `p_top` under `&ocean_psurf_nml in_eos`, else `eos%p_ref`) and per interface for the density ratio (at the true in-situ pressure). It is byte-identical to `"constant"` under a linear EOS, so **`"constant"` remains the default** and a nonlinear-EOS cavity run gets a configure WARNING rather than a refusal. **What remains:** every OTHER α/β-like quantity on this path already tracked the active EOS before E4 (EPBL, kappa-shear, tidal mixing, isopycnal slopes and Redi via `eos_specvol_derivs`; PP81/convective N², the wave speed and MLE by differencing `ms%rho_layer`), and `ocean_cavity_const_t` keeps its own FRACTIONAL ISOMIP+ pair on purpose. The one real gap left is not a coefficient: KPP's `B_0` line omits the `1/ρ₀` that EPBL's twin carries, so the two disagree by a factor ρ₀ for the same physical flux — untouched here because fixing it moves every KPP answer.
  - **BINARY cover — no partial cells at the calving front.** `cover_frac` is `merge(1, 0, z_draft > 0)`, so the front is a one-cell step: a cell is entirely under ice or entirely under sky, and an area-blended front is a follow-up. Both mask arithmetics are already written to take a fractional field unchanged — `1 − cover_frac` at cell centres, `1 − max(cover_L, cover_R)` on faces.
  - Inherits every `&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml` restriction: single rank, `fv_mom6`, sigma / z_fixed, no wet/dry, no porous barriers, no sea ice, no `bt_halo`, **no `&ocean_dataovr_nml` file-driven forcing** (the reader rewrites `tau_x`/`tau_y` — and `Q_heat`, unless `heat_to_component` — per time bracket with no access to `metrics%cover_frac`, so it would restore the unmasked atmosphere under the shelf; refused rather than half-wired).
  - **Diagnostics** (`&ocean_diag_nml diags`, derived catalog): `melt` (kg m⁻² s⁻¹, **+ = melting**), `melt_m_per_yr` (the ISOMIP+ reporting unit — `/ ρ_fw = 1000 kg m⁻³` × a 365-day year, factor **31 536** exactly; Asay-Davis et al. 2016 §3.3, and deliberately not the model's ρ₀ = 1035, which would put every number 3.5 % off the published figures), `thermal_driving` (`T_far − T_f(S_far, p_top)`), `haline_driving` (`S_far − S_b`), `tbdry`, `sbdry`, `tfreeze_ib` (the far field's in-situ liquidus at the ice base — distinct from `tbdry`, which is the liquidus at `S_b`; their difference IS the three-equation correction), `exch_vel_t` / `exch_vel_s` (the γ_T/γ_S the solve CONVERGED on, stored on the slot rather than re-derived — under `hj99`/`yung25` they are implicit functions of the interface state, and a re-derivation from `u*` would report the neutral values), `ustar_shelf` and `cavity_melt_status`. Plus two GEOMETRY diags that need only `&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml`: `z_draft` and `water_column` (= `bt_H_ref + bt_eta`, the datum identity). Outside the cover every one is the IEEE NaN sentinel, never zero — zero melt is a legal answer, and a plane of zeros over open ocean is how a 30 m/yr shelf gets averaged down and published — so the console's domain mean is a mean over the CAVITY and the line reports `missing=n/total`. Requesting one without its prerequisite knob is a fail-loud configure error, not an empty variable. Test: `test_ocean_cavity_diags`.
  - Reserved exchange laws (`jenkins91`, `rosevear22`, `vt19`, `mk18`, `burchard22`, `jenkins21`) and the reserved `ice_conduction="diffusive"` parse but are refused by name at configure — a reserved law and a typo stay distinguishable.
- **Ice-shelf top drag** (`&ocean_tdrag_nml enable`, default off ⇒ byte-identical) — a quadratic (ISOMIP+, `C_d = 2.5e-3`) or linear momentum sink at `k = nz` on ice-covered faces: the mirror of the bottom drag about the middle of the column, in its own slot (`ocean_top_drag_t`, `src/parameterizations/vertical/rdb_ocean_top_drag.F90`). Requires `&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml enable` — without a draft every face mask is zero and the kernel would be an inert cost. `htbl > 0` distributes the stress over the top boundary layer exactly as `hbbl` does at the bed, which is what keeps the explicit rate finite where a sigma coordinate thins the top layer near a grounding line. There are TWO implicit forms and they are different things: `&ocean_tdrag_nml implicit` makes the drag KERNEL backward-Euler (`u/(1 + dt·λ)`), unconditionally stable for any layer thickness and compatible with `htbl`; `&ocean_vdiff_nml implicit_top_drag` instead folds `dt·λ_top` into the vertical-friction tridiagonal's `k = nz` DIAGONAL, so the drag is solved together with the interior shear — layer-`nz` only, and mutually exclusive with the first (both damp the top layer; running both is a double count, not a stronger drag). Tests: `test_ocean_top_drag` (closed-form one-step quadratic, the mirror-of-bottom-drag identity, the distributed linear spin-down rate `r·htbl/h_nz` in both time-discretisations, the KE sink, the calving-front mask, the refusal matrix).

  - **The FACE cover rule is OR, and it is a choice.** `cover_frac` is cell-centred and binary; a u-face is under ice if EITHER abutting cell is (`cover_u(i,j) = max(cover(i−1,j), cover(i,j))`). So the **calving-front face feels the drag**. The alternative (AND) leaves it frictionless, which puts a slip line exactly where the cavity outflow jet leaves — the place the top stress is largest — and a spurious free-slip band there is systematically rectified into the overturning. Erring toward too much drag over one face width is the conservative error. Partial-cover area weighting is the v2 refinement.
  - **ONE drag coefficient for momentum and melt.** MOM6 carries two independent top-drag coefficients; this model deliberately does not. With both groups on, the melt slot takes its `C_d` from `&ocean_tdrag_nml cd`, and setting `&ocean_cavity_melt_nml cdrag_top` to a *different* value is a fail-loud configure error rather than a silent override. (`form="linear"` with melt on is a WARNING, not an error: the melt `u*` is quadratic by construction, so the two boundary conditions are then genuinely not one closure — analytic work only.)
  - **The barotropic mode does feel it.** The tendency is added into `F_slow` (`add_top_drag_into_F_slow`) before the depth mean that drives the barotropic substep, exactly as the bottom drag is. A layer tendency left out of that sum is invisible to the fast loop AND mis-corrected by `apply_bt_correction`, which subtracts `dt·F_bt` back out; the side-wall (channel) drag is the standing counter-example.
  - **Both paths now mask the wind under cover, and they use one rule.** The wind is masked at its SOURCE — `ocean_surface_stress_apply_cover` zeroes the `tau` pair on every face touching a covered cell — so the EXPLICIT top-drag path gets a covered face that carries the drag and no wind without any threading of its own. The face rule there is literally the one this slot uses (`max(cover(i−1,j), cover(i,j))`, rim faces untouched), enforced face-for-face by `cavity_cover_face_rule_matches_top_drag` rather than left as two copies of one sentence. The `(1 − cover_face)` scaling of the wind RHS on the IMPLICIT path is kept as belt and braces: it now multiplies an already-zero `tau`, costs one multiply on a row being assembled anyway, and keeps the fold correct standalone should a future forcing path write `tau` after the configure-time mask.
  - **Single rank, and inherits every `&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml` restriction** — `fv_mom6`, sigma / z_fixed, no wet/dry, no porous barriers, no sea ice, no `bt_halo`.
  - **No diagnostic catalog entry yet.** `stress_top` is device-resident and written every step, but nothing writes it to NetCDF. Inert, hence documented rather than refused.

- **An interior-sponge target INDEPENDENT of the initial condition** (`&ocean_sponge_nml target_source = "linear_z"`, default `"ic"` ⇒ byte-identical) — an ANALYTIC affine geopotential profile, `T(z) = lin_t_ref + lin_dt_dz·z` and the salinity twin (z positive UP, the `&ocean_zinit_nml source="linear"` convention), **re-evaluated on the LIVE layer geometry once per outer step** by `ocean_sponge_refresh_target`, called from `ocean_engine_step` beside `ocean_porous_refresh`. This lifts the previous limitation that the map-driven sponge's reference was always a snapshot of the IC, which made "restore to a different water mass than you start from" — ISOMIP+ Ocean1 (cold start, warm far field) and Ocean2 (the reverse) — **inexpressible**. Re-evaluated rather than frozen because under sigma/ALE the layer centres move (free surface, remap, ice lid), so a target sampled once at `t = 0` lives on the `t = 0` layer positions and drifts from the geopotential profile that was requested; where the sponge IS the whole forcing that drift changes the experiment rather than perturbing it. Depth is measured through the ice draft (a new `z_top(:,:)` on the sponge slot, latched at configure from `metrics%z_draft` — the draft is static by design). `Idamp = 0` masks the refresh exactly as it masks the relaxation, so a cell outside the band keeps its IC snapshot bit-for-bit; non-S/T tracers and `u_ref`/`v_ref` always do. Also new: `&ocean_sponge_nml ramp = "linear"` (default `"cosine"` ⇒ bit-identical), `(band − d − 0.5)/band`, the cell-centre evaluation of ISOMIP+ Eq. (20) `γ(x) = γ0·max(0, (x−x_r0)/(x_r1−x_r0))` — `γ0` is the existing `sponge_strength` (already 1/s) and the x-range the existing band width, so no `tau_boundary` knob was added. Gates: `test_ocean_sponge` (analytic profile under a sloping draft, the target tracking live layer motion, the `Idamp = 0` mask, exp(−t/τ) relaxation to the derived discrete factor, target ≠ IC, the `"ic"` no-op, the Eq.-20 ramp) and `test_ocean_zinit::sponge_linear_z_target_matches_the_zinit_seed` (cross-module convention gate: the two modules re-derive the same arithmetic because `rdb_ocean_z_init` is NetCDF-gated and `rdb_ocean_sponge` is not, so the test compares the numbers).
- **The default `target_source = "ic"` snapshot is taken on the SEED layers**, before the first regrid. It is only right where the seed already sits on the running coordinate. `z_fixed` + `&ocean_zinit_nml` seeds on its target for this reason (2026-09-30; before that the band was relaxed toward T/S from the wrong depths, a grid-scale, bathymetry-following density forcing — `validation_examples/ocean/coastal_noise_box`). `zstar_full` + `&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces` seeds on its target too (2026-10-02). Still snapshotted off-coordinate: `z_fixed` with a per-layer-index `&tracer_nml` IC, and `zstar_full` WITHOUT the knob (its sigma `b/nz` seed). `rho` and `hycom` have not been checked. `target_source = "linear_z"` is unaffected (it is rebuilt on the live geometry every outer step).
- **A file-backed (ISOMIP+) ice DRAFT** (`&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml draft_config="file"`, single rank) — ISOMIP+'s draft is BISICLES output with **no analytic form** (Asay-Davis et al. 2016 §3.1.1: "Because the ice-draft topography is derived from ice-sheet model results, it cannot be described by an analytic function"), so the protocol needs a reader. It now goes through the PR-14 static-2-D machinery (`ocean_data_input_load_static_2d`, a register/fill/close wrapper over `register_2d(time_mode="static")` + `fill_static_host` — until now that path had a complete tested reader and **no** production caller). The file contract is the reader's own, not weakened: the variable must be rank 3 in FORTRAN storage order `(x, y, t)` — which is how a C/Python writer and `ncdump` spell `(nTime, ny, nx)`, i.e. the ISOMIP+ file's own layout — with a time coordinate variable; record 1 is read and never re-read. There is **no horizontal interpolation**: the file must already be on the model grid, exactly as `bathymetry_file` and `&ocean_zinit_nml file` require, so the 1 km ISOMIP+ geometry needs an offline regrid to the 2 km ocean grid first. Sign convention is an **explicit knob**, never a guess: `draft_sign="depth"` (default, values are `z_draft >= 0`) or `"elevation"` (values are `z_d <= 0`, negated on load — **what the ISOMIP+ `iceDraft` variable needs**). A file in the wrong convention produces a negative draft and is rejected fail-loud by the existing non-negativity guard rather than silently accepted. After the read the field is sign-normalised, ghost-filled by constant extrapolation through the SAME `bathymetry_fill_ghosts_array` the file bathymetry uses, and then picks up the identical periodic/fold re-wrap + halo exchange the formula drafts get — so a file draft and a formula draft see identical boundary treatment. Multi-rank fails loud (the grounding statistics are single-rank reductions). The protocol's minimum-water-column rule maps onto `h_min_cavity` through `seed_wet_mask_impl(b - z_draft)` exactly as for a formula draft. Gate: `test_ocean_cavity_draft_file` (depth round-trip, the elevation negation incl. `+0` for open water, the wrong-sign rejection, dimension/missing-variable status, ghost fill, and the no-silent-default sign parser).
- **ISOMIP+ / MISMIP+ analytic BEDROCK** (`&ocean_topo_nml topo_config = "isomip_plus"`, default unreached ⇒ byte-identical) — Asay-Davis et al. (2016, *GMD* **9**, 2471–2497) Eqs. (1)–(4) with their Table 1 coefficients: the sixth-order along-flow polynomial `Bx(x)` plus the two-sided logistic trough `By(y)` (`d_c = 500 m`, `w_c = 24 km`, `f_c = 4 km`), clipped at `z_b,deep`. `&ocean_topo_nml max_depth` **is** the clip (protocol `720.0`) and the new `x_origin` (m, default `0`) places the model's west edge on the paper's absolute `x` axis (protocol `320000.0`), because `Bx` is written in the MISMIP+ frame with `x = 0` at the ice divide while the ISOMIP+ *ocean* box starts at 320 km. `By` is centred on the model's own `ny·dy`, which for the prescribed 80 km box IS the paper's `Ly`. A bed above sea level returns `b = 0` (land through the ordinary `LAND_DEPTH_THRESHOLD` path), never a negative depth; ghost rows are filled by formula per the standing rule. The protocol's minimum-water-column rule (their §3.1.5 — value left to the modeller, "modify the topography or mark the column land") is deliberately NOT applied in the setter: Roundabout takes the mark-as-land option through `&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml h_min_cavity` acting on `b − z_draft`. Gate: `test_ocean_topo_isomip_plus` (hand-evaluated `Bx`, `By`, assembled bed, the deep clip, ghost fill, the `x_origin` translation, and the above-sea-level land rule).
- **`&ocean_eos_nml p_ref`** (default `0.0` ⇒ byte-identical) — the reference pressure of the model's potential density `ms%rho_layer`, previously a declared-but-never-assigned member that was permanently 0. Raising it (e.g. `2.0e7` ≈ 2000 dbar, the usual σ₂ choice) selects the thermobaric state at which the effective α/β are evaluated, which matters near the freezing point at cavity pressures. **Horizontally uniform by design** — see above. Distinct from `&vcoord_nml rho_ref_pressure` (the RHO/HYCOM target-density *coordinate* and the density-space diagnostic remap); for a density-coordinate run the two should normally be set to the **same** value so coordinate and dynamics agree on what "density" means, but they are kept independent because a diagnostic remap to another reference is a legitimate request.
- **`&ocean_eos_nml tfreeze_set`** (default `"seaice"` ⇒ bit-identical) — the seawater **freezing-point (liquidus)** coefficient set. `eos_freezing_point` evaluates the linear `T_f = λ1·S + λ2 + λ3·p` for every EOS variant (MOM6 `TFREEZE_FORM="LINEAR"` parity), and the triple now lives on the `eos_t` handle rather than being hard-coded, so the sea-ice slot's handle and the vmix / EPBL / kappa-shear / tidal-mixing copies all inherit whatever is configured. `"seaice"` is the SIS2/MOM6 set `(−0.054, 0, −7.53e-8)` the shipped ice column model was ported against; `"isomip"` is the ISOMIP+ protocol set `(−0.0573, 0.0832, −7.53e-8)` (Asay-Davis et al. 2016, *GMD* **9**, Table 4 p. 2483, consumed in eq. (25) p. 2485), which the ice-shelf literature is unanimous on. The two differ by ~0.031 °C at S = 34.5 — enough to flip the **sign** of a basal melt rate over a 0.03 °C band of ocean temperature, which is why this is an explicit knob and why an unrecognised name is a fail-loud configure error rather than a silent default. **Named sets only:** λ1/λ2/λ3 are a fitted triple and there is no free-form coefficient knob, so a configuration cannot mix λ1 from one source with λ2 from another. **Scope:** this is the *ocean-side* liquidus only. The SIS2 ice model's internal brine-pocket slope (`ICE_DTF_DS`, `rdb_ice_enthalpy`) is baked into its closed-form enthalpy↔temperature map and is deliberately not switched, so under `"isomip"` the ocean surface freezing point and the ice-internal liquidus disagree by ~0.03 °C — acceptable because the ISOMIP+ set is for cavity work, where the sea-ice column model is normally off, but stated rather than hidden.

### Not yet shipped
- **A NONLINEAR liquidus** — MOM6's `TFREEZE_FORM = "MILLERO_78"` (Millero 1978, UNESCO TP28) or a TEOS-10 `t_freezing(SA, p)` polynomial. These are a different functional *form*, not another coefficient triple, and would dispatch at the documented seam in `eos_freezing_point`. Not implemented because the Millero (1978) coefficients are **unverified here** — the primary document could not be obtained — and this repository does not ship unverified constants.
- **Cavity pressure in the liquidus** — every shipped caller of `eos_freezing_point` (frazil, frazil uptake, basal flux) still passes `p = 0`, so λ3 is inert in production. Wiring the in-situ column pressure in is the follow-up named in the `p_top` list below.
- **File-driven `p_surf`** (reanalysis MSLP) — the NetCDF forcing reader itself
  ships (`&ocean_dataovr_nml`, above); `p_surf` is simply not one of its six
  tags (`tau_x`, `tau_y`, `heat`, `salt`, `evap`, `lprec`). Adding it is a
  `register_tag` entry plus a destination slot, not new reader machinery.
- **Sea-ice mass loading into `p_surf`** — deferred to the ice-loading PR (the `eta_ib` seam and the `sf%p_surf` overwrite convention are in place for it).
- **`p_top` in the FV-Wright / FV-lite `p_edge` top boundary condition** — those stacks are still seeded at 0. Only the FV-MOM6 `pa(nz+1)` carries the load, via `&ocean_pgf_nml p_top_in_bc` (shipped, above). Consequence for the FV-Wright path under a **sloping** load: the along-layer difference `p_centre(i) − p_centre(i−1)` omits `Δp_top`; that term is depth-uniform and already carried by the barotropic `eta_forcing` seam, so the momentum is not missing it, but the same cancellation-of-the-large-term argument that motivates `p_top_in_bc` applies there too. Separate PR.
- **The sloping-coordinate PGF corrections** — the load ships and a resting sloping cavity holds `7.08e-8 m/s` over 12000 s (above), but that residual is the *uncorrected* `N²D³/(12 dx H̄)` truncation and it grows as the CUBE of the draft slope: a grounding-line cell, where the per-cell draft step becomes comparable to the column depth, is decades worse. The correction family the literature uses there (top mass-weighting, reference-interface reset, flattest-interface fallback; or an `rx1` slope cap) is a later phase. `&ocean_pgf_nml mass_weight` today blends only at BED-inconsistent faces (`hWght` is built from `e_face(·,1)`); a sloping ice base is an undetected TOP-side inconsistency.
- **The true isostatic load** (`draft_source="in_situ"`, `p_ice = g∫ρ̂`) — fails loud. The shipped Boussinesq-isostatic `ρ₀·g·z_draft` leaves a depth-uniform `N²·z_draft·∇z_draft` residual in the raw PGF (measured `5.8e-6 m/s²`), which the default split hands to the barotropic mode as a small adjustment (the legacy `bc_pgf_forcing = .false.` split annihilated it).
- **The load-anomaly split on the `eta_forcing` seam** — `p_ice_total − ρ₀·g·z_draft` (the part the datum does not carry: an ice column whose true weight differs from the flotation load) has no producer. Note it must NOT be added to `sf%p_surf` wholesale — `η_ib` is built from the assembled total and would re-inject the datum-absorbed part; only the anomaly belongs there.
- **Ice-shelf cavity under a z-like vertical coordinate, under wet/dry, with sea ice, with tidal SAL, with a z-level T/S IC, or multi-rank** — each refused fail-loud rather than run unvalidated; the draft halo itself is two lines, but the grounding statistics are single-rank reductions.
- **A MULTI-RANK file-backed draft** — `draft_config="file"` reads a static 2-D NetCDF draft through the PR-14 reader (the ISOMIP+ draft is BISICLES output with no analytic form, Asay-Davis et al. 2016 §3.1.1), single-rank only: it fails loud on `px*py > 1`, like the rest of the cavity.
- **An AREA-BLENDED calving front** — `cover_frac` is binary (`merge(1, 0, z_draft > 0)`), so the front is a one-cell step. Every mask is already written as `1 − cover_frac` and would take a fractional field unchanged; what is missing is a producer for one.
- **A draft-offset z-level T/S initial condition** — `build_z_ctr` measures depth from the COLUMN TOP, which under a draft is `z_draft` metres below `z = 0`, so a geopotential `T(z)` profile would land systematically too shallow. Refused for now rather than silently mis-placed.
- **`auto_n_inner` under a shelf** — it derives each wet cell's external gravity-wave speed from `b`, the BED, not from `b − z_draft`. That overestimates `c_ext` and buys more barotropic substeps than the CFL needs: conservative and never unstable, and exactly right at a calving front, but it means two runs that differ only by a flat lid choose different substep counts unless `n_inner` is pinned.
- **`p_top` in the seven refused builders above**, in `&ocean_ice_nml`'s freezing-point callers (`eos_freezing_point(..., 0.0)` in frazil / basal flux / frazil uptake — the liquidus pressure depression is exactly what an ice-shelf load changes), and in the initialisation path — each a named follow-up, all currently fail-loud rather than silently inconsistent.
- **Ice-shelf-cavity surface-pressure curvature corrections / `MAX_P_SURF` load cap** — out of scope.

## I/O

### Shipped
- Per-rank NetCDF output (CF-1.8) driven by the diagnostics manager
  (`&ocean_diag_nml`), offline merge via `tools/merge_output.py`
- Diagnostics registry + cadence dispatch, per-diag output vcoord remap
  (z / sigma / density bins), MEAN/MAX/MIN/INTEGRAL time-ops
- Optional deflate compression
- Single-precision **diagnostic** output (`&ocean_diag_nml output_precision =
  "single"`, default `"double"` ⇒ byte-identical) — halves the bytes per frame
  on the write-bandwidth-bound diag stream.  Deliberately scoped to that
  one stream: restarts and the console conservation totals / checksums are
  unconditionally working precision, so a lossy restart is not requestable.
  Opting in means regenerating any regression baseline that byte-compares
  diagnostic NetCDF.
- Restart / warm start, bit-exact round-trip (including the wet/dry
  hysteresis registry) -- through the production engine path as well as
  the hand-built states: a resume reproduces the writer's next steps
  bitwise, ghosts included (`test_ocean_restart_engine`; on GPU, a 4-rank
  1/4-degree Southern Ocean resumed from day 730 matches the straight run
  bit-for-bit at day 732).  The checkpoint carries the `pred_corr`
  predictor's reused viscous tendency (`hvisc_du_visc`/`dv_visc`,
  optional on read: an older checkpoint resumes with one inviscid
  predictor), and setup does not re-seed the land columns or re-derive
  the prognostic ghosts on a warm start.  Sea ice included: the same
  engine-path gate runs thermo + ITD + EVP (stresses live, CFL clip
  firing) + the stress blend + the category transport + snowfall in a
  periodic channel, checkpointed MID thermo window, and compares every ice
  and ocean registry field plus the carried `tau`/`stress_mag`/`Q_heat`/
  `Q_salt` bitwise, ghosts included, both at the resume point and after
  the resumed steps, under both split schemes and under the
  surface-flux component set; the cold-start ice halo exchange is skipped
  on a warm start.  Under `&ocean_forcing_nml enable_components` the
  ASSEMBLED `Q_heat`/`Q_salt` are carried state (rebuilt at the end of a
  thermo step, read by the steps after it) and are checkpointed
  (`sf_Q_heat`/`sf_Q_salt` + `sf_q_assembled`, optional on read: an older
  checkpoint resumes with the configure seed + sea-ice fold, which differs
  in the last bit and drops any non-ice component until the next
  assembly); the component set is now allocated before the restart read,
  so the cavity's `sf_heat_cavity`/`sf_salt_cavity`, which were written
  but never restored, are restored too.  Decomposed: the sea-ice cases of
  `test_ocean_decomp_bitid_mpi` resume from per-rank checkpoints (4x1 and
  2x2, 2x1 on two ranks) bitwise against the straight decomposed run.

### Not yet shipped
- MPI I/O server hand-off for the diag manager — `&output_nml use_io_server`
  is accepted but warns and is ignored on this path; the emit is serial
  per-rank NetCDF.

- Lagrangian drifters
- Parallel collective NetCDF

## MPI (domain decomposition)

**The contract: a decomposed run IS the serial run.** Every owned value of
every prognostic field is bit-identical to the single-rank run on every
supported decomposition — not a global integral that agrees to round-off.
The gate is `tests/mpi/test_ocean_decomp_bitid_mpi` (ctest at 1, 2 and 4
ranks: every `px x py` factorisation — 2x1, 1x2, 4x1, 2x2, 1x4 — of fourteen
configurations under both `pred_corr` and `ssp_rk2`, 48 steps, every field
of the restart registry plus the barotropic `eta`, compared bitwise over
the owned cells). The configurations: a closed basin with an interior
island, a periodic seamount channel on z* with porous barriers, a
closed cooled spoon basin on z* with the visc_rem-weighted barotropic
corrector (`correction_visc_rem` + `implicit_drag`), a
periodic channel with a north sponge band, a tidal /
Flather open-boundary basin on zstar_sigma, a spherical sector (planetary
f, Wright EOS), an Orlanski + reservoir / clamped / west-sponge open
basin, the spherical sector with the closure set (EPBL, Fox-Kemper MLE,
GM + MEKE, Redi, kappa-shear, tidal mixing, convective adjustment,
geothermal heating, tracer hdiff), the three file-reader cases below (on
sigma, `zstar_full` and z*), a
tripolar cap (wind, double-Drake land reaching the fold line) whose 2x1,
4x1 and 2x2 splits fold through the distributed fold exchange, and sea
ice (thermo + ITD, EVP dynamics, the ice->ocean stress blend, in a
cooled periodic channel, without and with the category transport; every
ice registry field compared). It
passes on gfortran (CPU ranks), nvfortran CPU + HPC-X, and nvfortran (one V100
per rank). On the nvfortran CPU build `rdb_ocean_horizontal_viscosity.F90` is
compiled `-Mnofma` (`cmake/compiler_flags.cmake`): its vectorised kernels
otherwise round a face differently in the vector body and the scalar
remainder, i.e. by its position in the tile, and `pred_corr` carries that
tendency into the prognostics.
The tripolar north fold has its own gate,
`tests/mpi/test_ocean_tripolar_fold_mpi` (every split of 1-4 ranks, north-
south and east-west, whole storage windows incl. ghosts, three grids —
one beta-plane with land at the fold).

- **Process grid.** `&mpi_nml px/py` left at the default `1 x 1` on more
  than one rank is chosen by the engine: north-south (`px = 1, py = N`)
  under a tripolar fold (no fold exchange; an east-west split is supported
  but must be asked for explicitly with `px > 1`), the
  perimeter-minimising factorisation otherwise.
  An explicit `px*py` that does not match the rank count is refused.
- **File inputs are read per rank.** The supergrid (mosaic), bathymetry and
  z-level T/S IC readers read the file's whole-grid variables through
  start/count windows: the supergrid and bathymetry readers the full-width
  band of rows covering the tile (plus ghosts; the supergrid one padding
  row more), assembled as the single-rank code would and cut to the tile;
  the IC reader the tile's own window. `&ocean_dataovr_nml` forcing was
  already windowed. Every tile equals its slice of the serial arrays,
  seam ghosts included.
- **Console.** `&ocean_diag_nml reproducing_sums = .true.` is the default,
  so the status block prints the same digits on every rank count (budget
  `out`/`src` columns included; see *The summation-order floor* below).
- **Restarts** are per-rank and resume only on the SAME decomposition
  (checked on read, fail-loud).
- **CUDA-aware MPI**: a multi-GPU run needs `-DRDB_CUDA_AWARE_MPI=ON` (the
  driver refuses a host-staged multi-GPU build) and `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`
  pinned per rank before `MPI_Init` (see CLAUDE.md, *MPI*).

**Refused at configure on more than one rank** (fail-loud, every rank,
with a message naming the knob; keyed on the ACTUAL rank count in
`engine_setup`, so an auto-factored process grid cannot slip past):

| Feature | Why |
|---|---|
| `&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml enable` (and the melt / top-drag paths that require it) | the grounding statistics are global reductions the configure does not take; `draft_config="file"` has no windowed reader |
| `&ocean_wetdry_nml enable` | the wet-mask / outflow-limiter halo exchange is not implemented |
| `&ocean_ice_nml enable` with a tripolar north fold | the ice fields are not folded across the north seam |
| `&ocean_bc_nml` `'chapman'` edges | the edge-uniform eta target is a per-rank partial mean |
| `&ocean_vmix_nml dt_tracer_advect_ratio > 1` | the windowed drain's halo is not wired |
| tripolar fold with a north tile shorter than `nghost + 1` rows (`ny/py`), or tiles narrower than `nghost + 1` columns (`nx/px`, when `px > 1`) | the fold mirrors `nghost` rows below the fold line from the north tile itself; the width rule keeps every tile wider than its own ghost band |
| in-memory geometry injection (the API's staged bathymetry / supergrid arrays) | they describe the whole grid, not a tile (the file readers are windowed) |
| `nghost < 3` | the PPM stencil degrades to first order at a seam face (`ocean_halo_init`) |
| an explicit `&ocean_bt_nml bt_halo` wider than the smallest tile | the wide ghost ring must fit inside the tile |

**Not refused, but not bit-identical across decompositions** (known,
documented, the only such paths found):
- **The barotropic march-in** (`&ocean_bt_nml bt_halo > 0`) differs from
  the serial run at round-off over variable bathymetry and grossly with
  open boundaries. It is therefore OPT-IN: the default (`bt_halo = -1`,
  AUTO) resolves to 0 on every rank count, and a multi-rank run that sets it
  explicitly logs a warning.
- **An EAST legacy `'sponge'` edge together with a `'clamped'` north edge**,
  split in x, drifts at round-off on the east boundary face.  A west sponge
  edge (alone, or with Orlanski-open and clamped edges) and every other
  combination tested are exact.
- **`eulerian_z` under `ssp_rk2` with EPBL + Fox-Kemper MLE** drifts at
  round-off (3e-11 relative after 24 steps); EPBL alone, the pair on any
  other coordinate, or under `pred_corr` is exact (row
  `decomp_eulerian_z_ssp_rk2`).

**Not yet**: resuming a restart on a different rank count, a parallel (collective) NetCDF
writer (diagnostics and restarts are per-rank files, merged offline by
`tools/merge_output.py`).

**Global 1-degree (`validation_examples/ocean/global_1deg/`)**: runs on
1, 2 and 4 ranks (north-south splits), the state bit-identical across rank
counts; wall time per simulated day in the table below.

2-day runs of `global_1deg_unforced.nml` (360 x 320 x 50, dt = 1800 s,
48 steps/day), stepping wall time only, tripolar north-south splits
(px = 1, py = ranks).  The final state (h, u, v, T, S, the barotropic
fields, via the decomposition-invariant `&ocean_debug_nml chksum` bits) and
the whole console block are identical on 1, 2 and 4 ranks on each
platform; the 1-rank V100 run matches `reference_daily.csv` at 0.000 %.
The wind-forced `global_1deg_wind.nml` (the `&ocean_dataovr_nml` stress
file) is likewise identical on 1 and 2 V100s over one day.

| Ranks | V100s, one per rank (nvfortran 26.5, HPC-X, CUDA-aware) | CPU cores, one per rank (gfortran 15.1, OpenMPI 5.0.5, Xeon E5-2698 v4) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 12.9 s / simulated day | 910 s / simulated day |
| 2 | 8.1 s / day (1.6x) | 492 s / day (1.85x) |
| 4 | 5.8 s / day (2.2x) | 252 s / day (3.6x) |

At 1 degree a V100 is under-filled (5.8 M cells, 1.4 M per GPU on 4); the
GPU scaling is halo-latency bound, the CPU scaling near-linear.

## Performance and scaling

### Shipped
- Single source `do concurrent` + OpenACC, runs on NVHPC GPU/multicore, gfortran, ifx (OpenMP-target build also exercised).
- CUDA-aware MPI for halo exchange (`RDB_CUDA_AWARE_MPI`).
- Per-slot up-front memory reporting (`rdb_mem_report`) reconciled against the measured device mapping, so a gated-off closure provably costs nothing.
- Gated allocation for default-off closures (EPBL, kappa-shear, tidal mixing, GM, Redi, MLE, VarMix, MEKE, isopycnal slopes) — a plain run pays none of their multi-GB footprint.

### Headline numbers (single V100)

| Configuration | Wall time |
|---|---|
| Tasman 2 km (eddy-resolving, KPP + ALE + sponges) | ~34 s / simulated day |
| Double-gyre MOM6 ref (44 × 40 × 2, dt=1200) | ~16 s / 30 simulated days |

### Not yet shipped
- Mixed-precision tracers (fp32/bf16)

## Validation

Analytical / exact-solution tests shipped: vertical diffusion vs erfc, gravity-wave phase speed, geostrophic adjustment, lake-at-rest over a seamount, quiescent island-at-rest, Thacker moving shoreline (wet/dry), Eady baroclinic growth rate, Nansen free drift and Stefan melt (sea ice). ~177 `rdb_*` ctest entries over 180 test sources — 162 labelled `ocean`, 18 labelled `core` (`ctest -L ocean` / `-L core`); regime labels are mandatory per row and enforced by a pre-commit hook. MPI consistency tests for the C-grid halo (`tests/mpi/`). CPU↔GPU bit-comparison via the gcc + nvhpc CI matrix. A golden-output regression harness lives in `tests/regression/`.

Canonical benchmark configs live under `validation_examples/ocean/` — `seamount/`, `geostrophic_adjustment/`, `eady/`, `eddy_test/`, `double_gyre/`, `acc_channel/`, `neverworld2/`, `baroclinic_channel/`, `island_at_rest/`, `flow_past_island/`, `double_drake/`, `sea_ice/`, `tides/`, `sponge_demo/`, `ideal_age/`, `epbl_mld/`, `data_forcing/`, and others. Each has a README with expected behaviour, analytical scales (when applicable), and diagnostic interpretation of failure modes. `validation_examples/test_cases/tasman_validation/` carries the regional real-bathymetry case.

Not shipped: formalised observational comparison for a real domain, performance regression CI.

## Data assimilation

- **Shipped:** nothing beyond the namelist/restart surface and the sponge/nudging boundary machinery (`&ocean_sponge_nml`, per-edge asymmetric nudging), which is enough for relaxation toward a reference state.
- **Not shipped:** in-model observation operators, ensemble support, 4D-Var adjoint. The in-process state-setter API went with the FFI carve-out.

---

## Machine learning

Nothing built today, and no in-process API surface for a surrogate to plug into since the C/Python FFI was carved out with the coastal repo. A surrogate swap-in would need that seam rebuilt first.

## Ocean path (`sim_type='ocean'`)

The dynamical core of this tree, designed for regional /
basin-scale hydrostatic ocean. Operational as of 2026-05-24; the
MOM6-reference double-gyre setup runs stable to day 580 on a single
V100. Specific shipped surface below.

### Architecture

Arakawa C-grid (`u_face_x`, `v_face_y`, `eta` centred), split-explicit
RK2:

1. Slow tendencies — Coriolis advection, PGF, hvisc, vmix (implicit
   tridiagonal), bottom drag, surface stress, tracer hdiff/vdiff,
   vertical advection.
2. Barotropic fast loop — N forward-backward-Euler substeps on
   `(η, u_bt, v_bt)` + nonlinear `ζ + KE` terms; `auto_n_inner=.true.`
   derives N from the gravity-wave CFL each step.
3. BT correction — distributes the barotropic Δu back into the
   layers UNIFORMLY (the same increment in every layer, MOM6's
   `u_accel_bt`), optionally biased by the vdiff-produced viscous
   remnant γ (`&ocean_bt_nml correction_visc_rem`: weight
   `γ_k/⟨γ⟩_h`, depth mean preserved exactly) — γ is the momentum
   tridiagonal's own sensitivity to a uniform barotropic acceleration,
   so it biases the corrector's Δu against layers inside a frictional
   bottom boundary layer.  γ ≡ 1 (the fold reduces to the uniform one,
   bit for bit) unless `&ocean_vdiff_nml implicit_drag = .true.` also
   folds bottom drag into the vdiff operator — OR `&ocean_vdiff_nml
   bbl_glue = .true.` (the MOM6 BBL piston, which requires `hvel_mom6`),
   which folds the bed sink in regardless of `implicit_drag` (the glue
   REPLACES, not augments, the Rayleigh fold — see
   `rdb_ocean_vdiff.F90`'s `diffuse_velocity_columns_impl`).  The
   h-weighted fold (`correction_h_weighted`) is **RETIRED and refused at
   configure**: `Δu_k ∝ h_k` adds a positive-definite `½Δ²H(κ−1)` source
   plus a self-reinforcing shear feedback on any column whose layers
   differ in thickness (`κ−1 ≈ 0.2` on the 50-level tanh `z_fixed`
   stack); it grew the 1-degree Southern Ocean ~8× in KE by day 10 and
   to non-finite on day 16, and MOM6 has no such fold.
4. Stage 2 averages.

**PR-1 (visc_rem producer, call points, halo, restart — 2026-10-05).**
The producer (`vdiff_apply_momentum`'s `do_remnant` branch) was already
independent of `implicit_drag` (gated only on whether a caller supplies
`visc_rem_u/v`); what PR-1 closed:
- **Call-point `dt` bug**: under `split_scheme = "pred_corr"`, the
  stage-end producer used to be fused with the PREDICTOR's own
  velocity-apply call at `dt_vel = pc_be·dt` — MOM6's
  `VISC_REM_TIMESTEP_BUG` (default `.false.`) always builds the remnant
  at the OUTER step's full `dt`, never `dt_pred`
  (`MOM_dynamics_split_RK2.F90:777-779`). `vmix_apply_in_stage` now
  takes an optional `dt_remnant`; the predictor's two call sites pass
  `dt_remnant = dt`, which splits the remnant off into its own
  `visc_rem_precompute` call (run AFTER the velocity-apply, since the
  remnant matrix depends only on `{dt, h, kv, drag}`, never velocity).
  The corrector (`dt_vel ≡ dt` already) and `ssp_rk2` (no predictor
  off-centring) are unaffected.
- **Halo.** `visc_rem_halo_refresh` exchanges `bt_work%visc_rem_u/v`
  (MPI halo → periodic wrap → tripolar fold, MOM6's `pass_visc_rem`
  group pass) right after every production call, UNCONDITIONALLY —
  matching MOM6, which has no consumer gate on `pass_visc_rem` either.
  PR-1 shipped this gated on a BT-rem consumer
  (`correction_visc_rem`/`forcing_visc_rem`/`renorm_visc_rem`) because
  making it unconditional changed `rdb_test_ocean_dyn_mpi_4rank`'s
  hand-derived `check_exchange_counts` canary
  (`tests/mpi/test_ocean_dyn_mpi.F90`). PR-2 root-caused that: the
  counts were CORRECT (one extra face_x_3d + face_y_3d exchange per
  `pred_corr` stage, same `is_pc .and. decomposed` gating as the
  existing `u_av`/`v_av` seam fill) — the test's formula was stale, not
  the exchange broken. Verified directly at 1/2/4 ranks on gfortran +
  OpenMPI: mass/KE/salt/heat agreement stays at round-off
  (~1e-16) in every wall/island/periodic/poisoned leg whether the gate
  is present or not; `visc_rem_u/v` starts at `1.0` everywhere and the
  exchange is a same-shape, self-contained, blocking isend/irecv/waitall
  pair, so there is no tag collision, no unpaired request and no shape
  mismatch to poison anything. The gate is gone; `check_exchange_counts`
  now accounts for the unconditional refresh. The tripolar fold adds a
  `negate=.false.` contract to `fold_north_u_face`/`fold_north_v_face`
  (`rdb_ocean_fold.F90`): `visc_rem` is a positive SCALAR on a face
  (the viscous-remnant fraction), not a true-vector flux component, so
  the fold copies across the seam rather than sign-flipping (mirrors
  `fold_north_corner`'s existing vector/scalar `negate` contract).
- **Restart — CLOSED by PR-2 (2026-10-05).** `bt_work%visc_rem_u/v`
  was registered by PR-1 (`register_full_3d_opt`, optional on read) but
  that was **not sufficient** to close compat row `restart_visc_rem`:
  the row's real root cause was `visc_rem_precompute` reading the
  PREVIOUS stage's `vmix%kv`, a derived field that was never
  checkpointed, confirmed by a dedicated test
  (`test_engine_bit_exact_visc_rem` in
  `tests/test_ocean_restart_engine.F90`). PR-2 registers `vmix%kv`
  itself (`register_full_3d_opt`, tag `vmix_kv`,
  `ocean_state_build_restart_registry`) — `kv` is allocated
  unconditionally by every vmix configuration (PP81 always runs), so
  this is registered on every run rather than gated behind a visc_rem
  consumer flag (cheap: one extra `(nx, ny, nz+1)` field, the same
  class of cost as the already-registered `epbl_kd_int`). With `kv`
  checkpointed, `test_engine_bit_exact_visc_rem` runs the FULL round
  trip (resume + N more steps), not just the at-resume-point snapshot,
  and the compat row is deleted (`tests/regression/compat_expect.py`).

**PR-2 (bt_rem from av_rem — 2026-10-05).** `&ocean_bt_nml
bt_rem_from_visc_rem` (default off) builds `bt_rem_u/v` — the
multiplicative damping the barotropic substep applies each inner
step — from the SAME viscous remnant the layered momentum solve uses,
instead of the linear-piston `substep_drag` law or the static `1.0`
no-op: `av_rem_u/v = Σ_k frhat_k·visc_rem_k` (MOM6
`MOM_barotropic.F90:1553-1559`, reusing `face_depth_mean_u/v`'s own
arithmetic-mean face weight) then `bt_rem = mask·av_rem**(1/n_inner)`
(`:1572-1580`), built once per barotropic call after the visc_rem
producer and before the substeps. This is the fix for the MOM6
BOTTOMDRAGLAW glue's (`&ocean_vdiff_nml bbl_glue`) day-253 1° Southern
Ocean instability (`python_prototypes/design/visc_rem_bt_rem_plan.md`
§1): without it the barotropic solver sees only the weak explicit
drag carried in `F_slow` while the layers are strongly glued, so the
2Δx barotropic mode is undamped where the layered mode is heavily
damped. `strong_drag` (MOM6 `BT_STRONG_DRAG`, default off) swaps in
the rational approximation `n_inner·av_rem/(1+(n_inner−1)·av_rem)`;
`rescale_strong_drag` (MOM6 `RESCALE_STRONG_DRAG`, default off,
requires `strong_drag`) corrects `apply_bt_correction`'s Δu/Δv by
`min(bt_rem**n_inner/av_rem, 1.0)` for the rational form's
`bt_rem**n_inner ≠ av_rem` gap (the plain power form has no such gap
by construction). Fail-loud at configure: requires
`correction_visc_rem` (the producer); mutually exclusive with
`substep_drag` (D2 — bed drag would be double-counted, once inside
`visc_rem` via the glue/`implicit_drag` fold, once via the linear
piston) and with `bt_halo > 0` (the wide-halo BT clone carries no
`av_rem`/`visc_rem` ghost-width statistics, same posture as porous).
`av_rem`/`bt_rem` are built on the FULL face extent including ghosts
(halo-valid after PR-1's `visc_rem_halo_refresh`), verified
decomposition-invariant: `test_ocean_decomp_bitid_mpi`'s
`visc_rem_chain` case (`hvel_mom6`+`bbl_glue`+`correction_visc_rem`+
`bt_rem_from_visc_rem`) is bitwise IDENTICAL on every split of 1/2/4
ranks under both `pred_corr` and `ssp_rk2`. Default off ⇒ no answer
change. Test: `test_ocean_bt_rem_from_visc_rem` (closed-form
`bt_rem**n_inner == av_rem`, both forms; the `av_rem ≤ 0` mask; a
column spin-down identity through the real substep kernel; a
two-cell thin-channel slosh — 188 m / 8.4 m sill with a 0.74 m
partial bed cell / 70 m, `python_prototypes/bt_rem`'s geometry and
visc_rem profiles — bounded with the chain on, undamped/bounded
without).

**PR-3 (visc_rem chain audit + unification — 2026-10-05).** Audited every
existing `*_visc_rem` knob against MOM6 (`python_prototypes/design/
visc_rem_bt_rem_plan.md` §3/§4, D1-D3) and exposed ONE `&ocean_bt_nml
visc_rem_chain` switch (default off): equivalent to setting
`correction_visc_rem` + `forcing_visc_rem` + `renorm_visc_rem` +
`bt_rem_from_visc_rem` all at once — never a superset, never a subset
(`ocean_bt_*_visc_rem_on(cfg)` helpers in `rdb_config.F90`, read by both
`validate_config`'s cross-checks and `configure_ocean_bt`'s setup
wire-up, so the chain and the four individual knobs can never disagree).
The four knobs stay individually registered — never retired — for the
existing fine-grained tests; `strong_drag`/`rescale_strong_drag` stay
separate keys per D1 (MOM6's own `BT_STRONG_DRAG`/`RESCALE_STRONG_DRAG`
params) and now require `bt_rem_from_visc_rem` OR `visc_rem_chain`.  D2
(`substep_drag` mutually exclusive with the chain) and D3 (`strong_drag`
opt-in, default off) were already shipped by PR-2 and now read through
the chain identically. Findings from the audit:
- **`forcing_visc_rem`'s `wt_u` floor fixed to MOM6 exactly**
  (`MOM_barotropic.F90:1082-1101`): `vr = min(visc_rem, 1)`, `vr =
  max(vr, 1 − 0.5·Instep/(vr + subroundoff))`, `vr = max(vr, 0)`,
  `Instep = 1/n_inner`, `subroundoff = 1e-30` — `face_depth_mean_rem_u/v`
  previously ran a plain `[0,1]` clamp instead, which (per the plan's own
  "Thin-cell floors" risk note) can weight a many-substep column's
  forcing much closer to zero than MOM6 ever lets it on exactly the thin
  cells this chain exists for. `ieee_is_finite`-guarded (no `max(…,eps)`
  substitute on a non-finite input); threaded through `n_inner` into both
  `face_depth_mean_rem_u/v` call sites AND `set_cor_ref_velocity` (which
  shares the same weighting for the `pred_corr` Coriolis reference, now
  an optional `n_inner` defaulting to 1 — inert unless
  `bt_forcing_visc_rem` is also on). Default off ⇒ no answer change for
  any run that does not set `forcing_visc_rem`/`visc_rem_chain`.
- **Wind × surface `visc_rem` (MOM6 `MOM_barotropic.F90:1354,1380`,
  `BT_force_u = taux·IDatu·visc_rem_u(surface)`) was already covered**,
  not missing: `sum_slow_tendencies_into_F_slow` folds the wind-stress
  tendency (`ss%du_stress`, nonzero only at the surface layer `k=nz`,
  bottom-up) into `F_slow_u/v` at every layer BEFORE the depth-mean, and
  `forcing_visc_rem`'s weighted depth-mean (`face_depth_mean_rem_u/v`)
  then weights that `k=nz` wind contribution by `visc_rem_u(:,:,nz)`
  exactly like every other layer's slow tendency — no separate wind-only
  term needed.
- **`correction_visc_rem`/`renorm_visc_rem` ↔ MOM6's continuity `u_cor =
  u + du·visc_rem`**: the plan's citation (`MOM_continuity_PPM.F90`'s
  `continuity_adjust_vel`) is dead code in MOM6 (zero call sites); the
  real mechanism is `MOM_dynamics_split_RK2.F90:793-795,1052-1054`
  calling `continuity(... visc_rem_u=..., u_cor=u_av ...)`, with the
  actual weighted correction in `MOM_continuity_PPM.F90`'s
  `zonal_mass_flux`/`meridional_mass_flux` internals (`u_cor(I,j,k) = u +
  du·visc_rem`, roughly :891/:2051). roundabout's `renorm_visc_rem`
  targets exactly the same field MOM6 does, `ms%u_av_layer`/`v_av_layer`
  (verified at the `continuity_tracer_step_split(..., u_cor=ms%u_av_layer,
  v_cor=ms%v_av_layer)` call site) — a genuine match, not a gap.
  `correction_visc_rem`'s OWN weighted fold (`apply_bt_correction`,
  applied to the prognostic `ms%u_face_x_layer`/`v_face_y_layer`) has no
  literal MOM6 twin either — MOM6's `accel_layer_u` applies `u_accel_bt`
  UNIFORMLY there (see `accel_visc_rem` below) — but roundabout's
  architecture does not carry MOM6's separate `up`/`u_av` split the same
  way, so this fold is the closest roundabout analogue of the SAME
  physics applied to the field that plays that role here. Flagged for
  the maintainer as a design nuance the plan does not settle, not
  reworked in this PR (no answer change; PR-3 is audit-and-unify only).
- **`accel_visc_rem` is RETIRED** (`&ocean_vdiff_nml`, refused at
  configure): no MOM6 state-update equivalent exists.
  `btstep_layer_accel` (`MOM_barotropic.F90:3608-3677`) and the
  corrector's `up`/`vp` update (`MOM_dynamics_split_RK2.F90:702-704`)
  apply the depth-mean barotropic acceleration `u_accel_bt` UNIFORMLY
  across every layer — the only `visc_rem x u_accel_bt` products in MOM6
  are a diagnostic-only post-product (never fed back into state) and
  `RESCALE_STRONG_DRAG`'s depth-MEAN rescale (already its own knob). The
  underlying kernels (`accel_visc_rem_snapshot`/`accel_visc_rem_reweight`
  in `rdb_ocean_dyn.F90`) and `tests/test_ocean_accel_visc_rem.F90`
  (which call them directly, not through `cfg`) are untouched — only the
  namelist path to reach them is refused, naming `renorm_visc_rem` and
  `rescale_strong_drag` as the real MOM6 mechanisms.
- **frhat parity — reported, not ported.** roundabout's `av_rem`,
  `forcing_visc_rem`'s `wt_u` and `correction_visc_rem`'s corrector all
  share ONE face depth-mean weight, the plain two-cell arithmetic mean
  `0.5·(h_L+h_R)`. MOM6's `frhatu`/`frhatv` come from `btcalc`
  (`MOM_barotropic.F90:4546-4790`) and dispatch on `HVEL_SCHEME`:
  `ARITHMETIC` (roundabout's form), `HARMONIC`
  (`2·h_L·h_R/(h_L+h_R+h_neglect)`, which strongly suppresses a face
  where one side is thin — exactly the partial-bed-cell regime
  motivating this whole plan), or MOM6's practical default `HYBRID` (a
  shape-dependent arithmetic/harmonic blend, not flow/flux-dependent).
  At the plan's own motivating 8.4 m / 0.74 m geometry, MOM6's default
  already suppresses the thin side before `visc_rem` is even applied —
  roundabout's plain mean does not. The port itself would be small
  (`btcalc`'s default-arg form is a self-contained ~45-line-per-direction
  function of `h` alone, no PPM/flux coupling), but the plan requires
  porting it to EVERY depth-mean site in the chain at once (never just
  one, or the fold stops being self-consistent) — `av_rem`,
  `forcing_visc_rem`, AND `correction_visc_rem`'s corrector all share
  `face_depth_mean_u/v`/`face_depth_mean_rem_u/v`, which are also the
  GENERAL-purpose BT depth-mean used by every configuration, visc_rem
  chain on or off. Changing their weight formula is an answer change for
  every existing run, not a default-off opt-in one, so it is OUT OF
  SCOPE for PR-3 (no answer changes) and deferred as a measured finding
  for a follow-up PR, not implemented here.

Continuity is a transport equation (`∂h/∂t = -∇·(hu)`) solved with
**continuity-PPM** — no Poisson constraint, no FFT projection.

### Shipped — dyn-core operators

- **PGF**: Montgomery potential (`form="mont"`, `OPGF_VARIANT_MONT` —
  **the default** — the Boussinesq `M = p/ρ0 + (g·ρ/ρ0)·z` recursion plus
  one horizontal difference; general-purpose, valid over sloping
  bathymetry and every vcoord, and algebraically `fv_lite` on aligned
  columns), z-corrected FV (`fv_lite`), FV + Wright in-situ Picard re-eval
  (`fv_wright`), reduced-gravity 2-layer (`gprime`).  `gprime` is
  **NK=2-only** and now configure-enforced (PR-6): `form="gprime"` with
  `nz_layers /= 2` is a fail-loud abort, not a silent zero-PGF on the
  extra layers — use the default `form="mont"` for a general-nz PGF.
  `mont` and `fv_lite` carry the SAME physics content (layer-mean ρ, no
  in-layer quadrature) and coincide algebraically wherever the two columns
  meeting at a face have equal layer thicknesses.  They are genuinely
  different discretisations where thicknesses are UNEQUAL — σ / z*σ over a
  slope — and NEITHER is exact there; that residual is the open
  sigma-coordinate PGF error, not a property of one form.
- **EOS**: Wright (1997) nonlinear rational fit (production); linear
  EOS available, with its full reference state namelist-settable —
  `&ocean_ic_nml alpha_T / beta_S / T_ref / S_ref / rho_0`.  `alpha_T`
  and `beta_S` are DIMENSIONAL (kg/m³ per unit T/S), so a protocol's
  fractional 1/°C, 1/PSU coefficients must be multiplied by `rho_0`
  first — see `docs/REFERENCE.md` §Equation of state.  The thermal-
  expansion / haline-contraction pair of the ACTIVE EOS is available as
  `eos_buoyancy_coeffs` (`α = −∂ρ/∂T`, `β = +∂ρ/∂S`, analytic per
  variant, device-callable); `&ocean_vmix_nml buoyancy_coeffs="eos"`
  routes it into the KPP `B_0` and the double-diffusion density ratio,
  which otherwise use the scalar linear-EOS pair (default, and exact
  under `eos="linear"`).
- **Coriolis**: Sadourny PV-flux (`sadourny`); Sadourny +
  Hollingsworth-Källén guard (`sadourny_hk`, enums live, kernel
  refinement deferred). Under `&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces` the HK
  stencil runs pair-floored (each PV at a corner thickness of at least
  half its pair's larger face thickness — the bound `sadourny_energy`
  has by construction); without it a thin live partial bottom cell made
  the HK cross pairs run away (1-degree Southern Ocean: NaN at step 11).
  Byte-identical with the knob off; `docs/CLOSURE_MATRIX.md`, Coriolis.
- **Lateral closures**: Leith (vorticity-gradient ν_h per face);
  Smagorinsky_KH + Smagorinsky_AH (flow-aware biharmonic); constant
  `nu_h` / `nu_4` floors.
- **Barotropic linear (Rayleigh) wave drag** (`&ocean_bt_nml wave_drag`,
  Egbert & Ray 2001; Jayne & St Laurent 2001): the bulk energy sink for
  the barotropic tide — a static per-face piston velocity `r_H(x,y)`
  MULTIPLIED into the BT-substep damping factor `bt_rem_u/v`, composing
  with `substep_drag`. Default off ⇒ bit-identical. Under
  `&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces` it (and `substep_drag`) damps on the
  OPEN-column face depth `Σ_k h_face·open`. `substep_drag` itself builds its factor
  from the LINEAR bottom-drag coefficient `&ocean_bdrag_nml r` only, so
  under `form /= "linear"` it is a no-op (`r = 0`, the default) or a
  drag the slow step never applies — `validate_config` WARNS naming both
  knobs. `form="uniform"` or
  `form="roughness_proxy"` (a documented resolved-bathymetry-variance
  placeholder for the real subgrid `⟨h²⟩`); `form="file"` fails loud at
  configure pending PR-14's NetCDF map reader.
- **Fox-Kemper mixed-layer-eddy restratification** (FK08/FK11, B5,
  `&ocean_foxkemper_nml enable`): submesoscale ML eddies slump lateral
  buoyancy fronts via an overturning streamfunction
  `Ψ = Ce·(H_ml²/|f|)·∇b̄·μ(z)`.  Injects ML-confined per-layer mass
  transports into the continuity mass fluxes BEFORE the divergence (never
  touches velocities) ⇒ conservative by construction (`Σ_k a(k)=0`, a
  closed overturning cell — verified to round-off).  `H_ml` from
  `epbl%mld` (EPBL is the enabler; requires `ocean_epbl_nml enable`).
  Surface transport is westward toward the dense column (restratifying).
  Two timescale forms: bare `Ce/max(|f|,f_floor)` (analytic-gate default)
  and the FK11 momentum-mixrate form (`use_mom_mixrate`, **production-
  recommended** — suppresses restratification under vigorous mixing).
  Runs at thermo cadence, once per outer step; bandwidth-bound 2D + per-
  layer μ scatter.  Default off ⇒ bit-identical.  Deferred:
  `resolution_taper` (B2 res_fn double-counting hook, hard error until
  B2), slow-filtered-MLD second transport (instantaneous MLD only),
  μ cubic tail (`tail_dh`).  Tests: `test_ocean_foxkemper`.
- **Vertical mixing**: PP81 (Richardson) interior + KPP Phase 1
  (shear-driven bulk-Ri sweep + shape function `G(σ) = σ(1-σ)²`) +
  KV_ML_INVZ2 (MOM6 inverse-z² surface band over `HMIX_FIXED`) +
  DT_THERM cadence skip + HARMONIC_VISC face-thickness option.
  KPP's convective scale takes `w_* = max(0, −B_0·h_b)^(1/3)` from the
  surface buoyancy flux `B_0 = (g/ρ₀)·(α_T·F_T − β_S·F_S)` — the same
  quantity EPBL forms from the specific-volume derivatives, gated
  against it to round-off by `test_ocean_buoyancy_flux` and exposed as
  the diagnostic `vmix%b0`.  **`α_T` / `β_S` are DIMENSIONAL**
  (kg m⁻³ per °C / PSU, the density-anomaly form — see the EOS units
  box in `docs/REFERENCE.md`), which is why the `1/ρ₀` is there; the
  historical `alpha_T = 1.7e-4` default is numerically the FRACTIONAL
  coefficient, so it masks a missing `1/ρ₀` and is not a physical
  configuration for any run that cares about surface buoyancy forcing.
- **Convective adjustment** (Brunt-Väisälä trigger, CVMix
  `CVMix_convection`-style, `&ocean_conv_nml enable`, default off ⇒
  bit-identical): where the interior `N² < n2_thresh` (dense-over-light),
  raises `kt -> max(kt, kd_conv)` / `kv -> max(kv, prandtl_conv·kd_conv)`,
  strictly below the active KPP/EPBL boundary-layer depth (the BL owns
  its own convective response — `w_*` / convective TKE).  `kd_conv`
  defaults to 1.0 m²/s, ~100× PP81's own `Ri<0` ceiling (~1.01e-2
  m²/s), admissible only because `vdiff_apply_tracers` /
  `vdiff_apply_momentum` are unconditionally-stable backward-Euler
  solves.  A CONTRIBUTOR (`max()` floor, not an additive increment):
  feeds `vmix_assemble` like every other interior closure.  Two v1
  limits vs. MOM6's `MOM_CVMix_conv`: **D1** the N² trigger uses a
  single global `p_ref` potential density (`ms%rho_layer`), not a
  locally-referenced interface-pressure density, so thermobaricity is
  neglected (same assumption PP81 already makes); **D2** uses `max()`
  rather than MOM6's additive `Kd += kd_col` (differ by at most the
  resolved interior Kd, ≤1% of `kd_conv` — physically immaterial, and
  `max()` is exact/idempotent under the every-RK2-stage call cadence).
  Writes `kv`/`kt` only, never `ks` — `ks` is not rewritten by any
  per-stage contributor today, so a `max()` floor on it would ratchet
  monotonically and never relax; salt convects for free once a future
  `ks <- kt` split runs downstream of this call (until then salt
  genuinely does not convect, a pre-existing limitation this closure
  does not worsen).  Tests: `test_ocean_convection`.
- **EPBL** (Reichl & Hallberg 2018 energetics-based PBL,
  `&ocean_epbl_nml enable`): prognostic TKE budget per column —
  wind (`mstar·ρ₀u*³dt`) + convective (`nstar`-weighted) energy
  spent interface-by-interface via a closed-form energy solve;
  the MLD is where the energy runs out (false-position root-find,
  previous-step seed).  mstar schemes `constant`/`om4`/`rh18`;
  gravity-wave column-height correction; per-column TKE-budget
  diagnostics that close to round-off.  Replaces the KPP overlay
  when on (mutually exclusive); combines with PP81 `add`/`max`;
  `Kv = prandtl·Kd`.  Runs at thermo cadence; scalar-carry GPU
  sweep (no per-column work arrays).  **Langmuir enhancement
  shipped** (`use_lt`): LF17 wind-only statistical waves — COARE 3.5
  u*→U10 + Phillips-spectrum surface-layer-averaged Stokes drift,
  one scalar La per column, Reichl & Li (2019) mstar enhancement
  (rescale/additive) with the Li et al. (2016) stability-modified
  La; zero wave-model coupling, zero Stokes arrays.  Design + MOM6
  knob mapping: `docs/generated_nml_knobs.md`.
  **Penetrating shortwave now charged** (PR-21, `&ocean_thermo_nml
  epbl_sw_ctke`, default on): the per-layer `cTKE` ledger pays the
  in-layer PE cost of the exponentially-distributed SW absorption
  (`Phi(h/zeta)·`skin-cost, MOM6 `absorbRemainingSW` shape), filled in
  the prep sweep and drained in the interface sweep; charging the truth
  (rather than dumping all SW at the skin) DEEPENS the midday MLD.  Inert
  at `sw_pen_frac=0` ⇒ bit-identical.
- **kappa-shear** (Jackson, Hallberg & Legg 2008 prognostic shear
  turbulence, `&ocean_kappa_shear_nml enable`): INTERIOR closure —
  per-column coupled (κ, TKE) steady-state equations solved by Picard
  iteration with adaptive time-substepping; the diffusivity diffuses
  vertically with a stratification/rotation/boundary-limited decay
  length, so resolved shear layers entrain correctly at marginal Ri and
  the mixing is self-limiting (relaxes the column toward Ri ≳ Ri_c).
  Coexists with KPP/EPBL (additive: `kt += κ`, `kv += prandtl_turb·κ`
  every stage; column solve at thermo cadence).  Tracer-point path,
  Picard-only, Boussinesq; no massless-layer merging yet (vanishing
  ZSTAR_FULL layers are floored in the gather).  GPU: one
  `do concurrent` column kernel, all-local fixed-size arrays (the
  MRE-measured L1 layout; 255-register/12.5%-occupancy bound).  Kernel
  matches the validated single-column prototype to ~1e-13.  Knob mapping:
  `docs/generated_nml_knobs.md`.
- **First-baroclinic wave speed + Rossby radius** (B1, Chelton et al.
  1998, `&ocean_wavespeed_nml enable`; **diagnostic, default off**):
  per-column `cg1` (m/s) + first-mode Rossby deformation radius `Rd`
  (m) + `Rd/dx`, called once per outer step (thermo-cadence-gated,
  further gated by `n_wavespeed`) in `ocean_dyn_step_split`, BEFORE
  both `varmix_compute` call sites and `run_meke_step` — feeds the B2
  GM/Redi/MEKE resolution-aware scaling (`&ocean_hvisc_nml
  resoln_scaled_visc`, `&ocean_varmix_nml resoln_scaled_khth/khtr`,
  MEKE's `Ldeform`).  `ocean_dyn_step` (the unsplit path) does not call
  it.  Rigid-lid Sturm–Liouville eigensolve discretised
  from `rho_layer` (no T/S re-eval): per-interface reduced gravity with
  a static-instability floor, a backtracking convective layer-merge
  preconditioner (welds inverted/degenerate layers so no zero-`gprime`
  row survives the active range — closes the partial-inversion blow-up),
  then a fixed-budget (40-iteration, no early-exit → warp-divergence-free)
  Sturm-count bisection for the largest `c²`.  Equatorial `Rd` uses the
  smooth `cg1/sqrt(f² + 2β·cg1)` blend, where `f` (`f_centre`) and `β`
  (`beta_centre = |∇f_centre|`) are both static fields filled at
  configure from `metrics_fill_coriolis` (planetary dispatch on
  spherical/tripolar, bit-identical beta-plane elsewhere) — not a
  hard-coded beta-plane / namelist-scalar `β`.  `rd_over_dx = Rd /
  metrics%dxT` (metres — NOT `grid%dx`, which is degrees on
  spherical/supergrid/tripolar; bit-identical to the old expression on
  Cartesian, where `dxT ≡ grid%dx`).  GPU: outer-shim + explicit-shape
  flat-impl kernel, 5 fixed-size column arrays, divergence-free
  fixed-budget bisection (no data-dependent early-exit) — occupancy
  comfortably above the kappa-shear cliff per the dev-time MRE.
  Matches the verified Python reference prototype to ~1e-6; golden
  nz=4 column `cg1 = 3.266407 m/s`.  Deferred: the equivalent-barotropic
  (`use_ebt`) and N²-monotonising (`mono_n2`) EBT refinements (knobs
  reserved, default off); the `|∇|f||`-vs-`|∇f|` equator kink shared
  with VarMix/MEKE (house idiom, not fixed here).
- **Bottom drag**: `linear` (Rayleigh rate, 1/s) and `quadratic`
  (log-layer, MOM6/ROMS default `Cd ≈ 2.5e-3`). Both have an
  HBBL-distributed mode that spreads the stress across the bottom
  `hbbl` metres rather than the bed-most layer alone.
  Both modes — and the implicit-fold rate `lambda_bot_u/v` and the vdiff
  bed row it is added to — sit on each face's first LIVE layer counting
  up from the bed, `multilayer_state_t%k_bot_u/v` (`max` of the two
  columns' `k_bot`; `≡ 1` off `z_fixed`, so bit-identical there).  Under
  `z_fixed` the static bed fillers below it are identity rows of the
  momentum solve and take no share of the HBBL band.
  **Limit:** `k_bot ≡ 1` under `zstar_full` (its bed-side layers vanish
  DYNAMICALLY, no configure-time pattern) and, until `configure_ocean_k_bot`
  learns it, under `zstar` (static `z_fixed` fillers): the bed-only mode
  (`hbbl = 0`) drags layer `k = 1`, an inert filler in every column
  shallower than the deepest nominal layer.  Configure warns; use
  `hbbl > 0` there (it accumulates thickness from the bed up and reaches
  the live bottom layer).  `&ocean_vdiff_nml implicit_drag` with
  `hbbl > 0` stays refused — not a `k = 1` problem any more: the fold is
  ONE 2-D rate on the bed-row diagonal and cannot represent a band; that
  needs a per-layer `lambda_bot` added to the interior diagonals.
- **Side-wall (channel) drag** (`&ocean_bdrag_nml channel_drag`,
  `cdrag_side`; default off ⇒ bit-identical): a per-layer lateral
  Rayleigh rate at every face whose cross-stream perimeter is blocked by
  land or a vanished neighbour layer, applied as a frozen-rate
  backward-Euler factor `u ← u/(1 + dt·λ_side)` — thin-layer stable, and
  a literal no-op on an all-wet flat bed. **Limitation, documented not
  defective:** because it is multiplicative rather than an additive
  `du/dt` buffer, it is the one corrected-set tendency NOT summed into
  the split solver's `F_slow`, so the barotropic substep does not feel it
  *during* the fast loop and the time-mean transports `bt_uhbt` handed to
  continuity are undragged. The depth mean is still applied exactly once
  (`apply_bt_correction` adds an increment, it does not replace the depth
  mean), so nothing is lost or double counted — the cost is one
  first-order-in-dt operator split. Algebra, decision table and the
  analytic gate (`tests/test_ocean_bt_slow_forcing.F90`, both split
  schemes, agreement to ~1e-14) are in the "`F_slow` seam contract"
  section of `src/core/ocean/README.md`. Folding it into `visc_rem` for
  MOM6 parity is future work, alongside the barotropic-coupling flip for
  the implicit stress/drag folds.
- **Time-varying NetCDF input reader** (PR-14, `rdb_ocean_data_input`):
  the shared, target-agnostic reader every forced-hindcast/regional-
  nesting capability builds on. A consumer registers a `(file,
  variable, destination)` triple via `ocean_data_input_register_2d/_3d`
  (or the OBC-segment variants) and gets back an opaque `id`; the
  driver's one-line `ocean_data_input_update_all` hook refreshes every
  registered field's time bracket each outer step and blends linearly
  in time ON-DEVICE into the caller's own, whole, mapped array —
  `linear`/`cyclic` (explicit-period climatology)/`static` time modes,
  out-of-range default abort (opt-in clamp per field),
  `fill_static_host{,_3d}` for setup-time static fills before a
  destination is device-mapped. Files must be pre-regridded to the
  model horizontal grid (no in-core horizontal interpolation, no
  vertical remap of a source z axis, no calendar). **Still missing**
  are file-backed OBC segment data and NetCDF climatology restoring,
  both of which this reader unblocks but does not itself deliver.
- **File-backed surface forcing** (PR-15, `&ocean_dataovr_nml`,
  `rdb_ocean_data_forcing`) — the first consumer of the reader above,
  and what makes an atmospherically forced hindcast possible. Flat
  per-tag knobs (`<tag>_file`, `<tag>_var`, `<tag>_scale`,
  `<tag>_add`) bind a time-varying NetCDF field onto a forcing slot;
  a blank `<tag>_file` leaves that slot on its configure-time
  scalar/formula value, and `enable = .false.` (default) registers
  nothing ⇒ bit-identical. Tags: `tau_x`/`tau_y` (→ the C-grid face
  stress, with `stress_mag` re-derived after every blend so KPP/EPBL
  see the current wind), `heat`, `salt`, `evap`, `lprec`. The heat and
  salt destinations depend on `&ocean_forcing_nml enable_components`:
  off ⇒ `Q_heat`/`Q_salt` direct, on ⇒ the `heat_added`/`salt_flux`
  components (because `ocean_surface_flux_assemble` rebuilds
  `Q_heat`/`Q_salt` from the component set every thermo step). `evap`
  and `lprec` exist only in the component set and fail loud without
  it. Time-axis mode (`linear`/`cyclic`/`static`), `cycle_period`,
  `t_offset` and the out-of-range policy are **shared by every tag** in
  v1 — a per-tag time mode (interannual winds alongside a cyclic SST
  climatology) is the known follow-up. Stress ghost cells are filled by halo
  exchange + periodic wrap + tripolar fold, never by extrapolation, and
  the same refresh runs for the analytic `wind_config` seeds — so the
  wind seam is correct under decomposition (the flux tags need no ghost
  fill: they are applied column-locally).  The stress file is C-grid
  staggered and must carry `nx_phys+1` x-face values / `ny_phys+1`
  y-face values. Online bulk formulae are out of scope: v1 consumes
  offline-preprocessed, model-grid fluxes. The sea-ice `tau_a`
  atmospheric-stress snapshot is still taken once at configure, so it
  does **not** follow a time-varying wind.
- **Dynamic wetting/drying** (`&ocean_wetdry_nml enable`, default off ⇒
  byte-identical; spec + prototype numbers in `docs/ocean_wetdry_plan.md`):
  per-substep hysteresis cell wet mask (`dry_depth`/`rewet_depth`) +
  UPWIND BT face thickness + per-cell positive-definite outflow limiter
  (`θ = min(1, avail/outflow)`, faces scaled by `min(θ_L, θ_R)` ⇒ total
  depth `D ≥ 0` unconditionally, NO thin-film mass injection — conserves
  to round-off) + bed-blocking momentum gate (a face into a dry cell is
  a wall unless the wet surface overtops the dry bed) + `FROUDE_CAP`
  thin-face runaway-velocity guard.  Composes multiplicatively on top of
  the static land masks; layer velocities at blocked faces reset via
  `mask_layer_velocities`; surface heat/salt flux masked on dry columns.
  Envelope (all fail-loud at configure): sigma vcoord,
  single-rank, split solver + `ppm_limit_pos` required; mutually
  exclusive with BT_cont / upstream-h / sw_pen / restoring / geothermal.
  Thacker moving-shoreline gates: period < 2%, shoreline < 4 cells
  (measured −0.9% / 3.6 cells), ~12%/period front dissipation on the
  frictionless runup (documented limit).  **v2 intertidal seed**
  (`land_margin`, default 5 m, consulted only when `enable=.true.`):
  the static land seed becomes `b < -land_margin` (bed above the
  highest credible water level) instead of the 2 m rest-depth test, so
  truly intertidal terrain — bed between LWL and HWL, including
  rest-dry columns — keeps real metrics and floods/dries dynamically.
  The seed floors each layer to `2·H_VANISHED` (never 0, and above the
  strict `h_old > H_VANISHED` remap-drain gate so seeded S/T survives
  the first regrid), so a starts-dry column sits at a *vanished*
  `D ≈ nz·2·H_VANISHED > 0` with bed-blocked faces until overtopped —
  not literal `D = 0`.  Caveat: formula-topo land at `b ≈ 0` (island /
  double_drake), `neverworld2` continents, and make_bathy `b = 1 m`
  land-flag cells are all intertidal/wet under the knob-on criterion —
  true static land needs `b < -land_margin`.  `configure_ocean_wetdry`
  emits a WARNING via a condition-based post-seed scan (counts interior
  cells with `b ∈ [-land_margin, LAND_DEPTH_THRESHOLD)`), so this is
  caught for name-less topos and file bathymetry too.  **Zero-depth (D≈0)
  hardening** (Finding A, `docs/ocean_wetdry_zero_depth_plan.md`): the
  EOS `h > 0` gates are tightened to `h > H_VANISHED` (a mid-drain layer
  in `(0, H_VANISHED]` returns the reference density, not a corrupted
  `hS/h`), the seed + `bt_h` floor and the drain-surviving `2·H_VANISHED`
  value are in place, and the controlled vanished-column full-driver test
  (`wetdry_vanished_column_flood`) confirms a seeded-vanished interior
  column with a density gradient floods cleanly, no NaN, tracers conserved.
  DEFERRED: a proof at *exactly* `D = 0` (all layers at literal 0, no
  floor) — the shipped path never produces it (seed + limiter keep
  `h ≥ 2·H_VANISHED` / `h ≥ 0`), so this is a defence-in-depth corner, not
  an operational gap.  Restart round-trip is
  BIT-EXACT (`wd_wet_dyn` hysteresis state registry-carried; transient
  wd_* recomputed) — gated by `restart_bit_exact_wetdry`.
  `test_ocean_wetdry` (+ `wetdry_starts_dry`, `wetdry_seed_criterion`,
  `wetdry_emerged_beach_multilayer_step`, `wetdry_emerged_tracer_gradient`,
  `wetdry_vanished_column_flood`)
  + `test_ocean_wetdry_driver` (full-driver tracer conservation through a
  dry→wet→dry band cycle: `Σ hS`/`Σ hT` drift 7.5e-16).  **Remaining v1
  gap** (unchanged by v2): the surface-flux dry gate is *binary* — a
  column held wet in the hysteresis band (`dry_depth < D < rewet_depth`)
  receives the full unthrottled heat/salt flux over its mm-scale top
  layer (no thickness-aware throttle), quantified in
  `test_ocean_wetdry_driver`.
- **Surface stress**: 2D `tau_x/tau_y` on the top layer; MOM6
  `DIRECT_STRESS` distributes it over `hmix_stress` metres.
- **Surface heat / salt flux** (`&ocean_thermo_nml q_heat / q_salt`):
  scalar `Q_heat` / `Q_salt` stamped into the top layer (`k=nz`).
- **Surface-flux component set** (`&ocean_forcing_nml enable_components`,
  default off ⇒ no array allocated, `Q_heat`/`Q_salt` unchanged): grows
  the scalar `Q_heat`/`Q_salt` fill into a MOM6-shaped component set on
  `ocean_surface_flux_t` — `q_sw`/`q_lw`/`q_lat`/`q_sens`/`heat_added`,
  the mass-flux set (`evap`/`lprec`/`fprec`/`vprec`/`lrunoff`/`frunoff`/
  `seaice_melt`), a `heat_content_*` enthalpy companion per mass flux,
  `salt_flux`, and `p_surf_atm`/`p_surf`. `Q_heat`/`Q_salt` become
  **derived views** rebuilt every thermo step by
  `ocean_surface_flux_assemble` from the const scalar + the components.
  **v1 limits, stated plainly**: mass fluxes are stored and carry
  enthalpy/salt bookkeeping but do **NOT** change column mass (no real
  freshwater — that is a named follow-up); `salt_flux` stays **virtual**
  (no column-mass change, same as the pre-PR-12 `Q_salt`); `p_surf`/
  `p_surf_atm` are stored with **no consumer** yet (the inverse-barometer
  PGF fold is a same-release-cycle follow-up); `q_sw` is now a selectable
  irradiance source for shortwave penetration + the boundary-layer SW
  coupling (`&ocean_thermo_nml sw_source="q_sw"`, PR-21 — requires
  `enable_components`; default `"net_heat"` stays bit-identical). The only v1 filler is the
  sea-ice coupler (`rdb_ice_ocean_coupler`), which writes `salt_flux`/
  `heat_added` instead of overwriting `Q_salt`/`Q_heat` directly when
  components are on — bit-identical to the legacy full-overwrite path.
- **Geothermal bottom heat flux** (`&ocean_geothermal_nml enable /
  q_geo`, default off): bed-side analogue of the surface heat flux —
  a constant `Q_geo` (W/m², positive into the ocean from below;
  Davies/Pollack global mean ~0.05–0.1) deposited into the lowest
  *massive* layer (`k=1` in the common case, falling to the first
  layer above a pinched ZSTAR_FULL bed). Heat only, thermo cadence,
  `heat_budget_geothermal` accounting contributor.
- **Vertical advection** (Eulerian): w diagnosed from continuity;
  tracer + h_layer conservation gated by remap.
- **ALE remap**: PPM stencil (`remap_method="ppm"`, default); momentum,
  h_layer, all tracers; drift ≤ 1e-15 / 10 remaps. Optional **PPM_H4**
  (`remap_method="ppm_h4"`) swaps the interior edge estimate for the
  thickness-weighted non-uniform 4th-order stencil (White & Adcroft 2008),
  which stays 4th-order on non-uniform ALE layers where plain PPM degrades to
  2nd — cutting the spurious diapycnal mixing injected per remap (Ilicak 2012).
  Reuses the PPM limiter + parabola + conservative redistribute verbatim
  (conservation/monotonicity unchanged). Boundary edges use PCM-outermost +
  3-cell H3; the 4×4 cubic-fit boundary is a documented upgrade. Optional
  **PQM** (`remap_method="pqm"`) — White & Adcroft (2008) `PQM_IH4IH3`:
  implicit-h4 edge values + implicit-h3 edge slopes (per-column tridiagonal
  solves) + monotonicity limiter, ~5th-order convergence on smooth profiles
  vs PPM's 2nd. **Reachable** (both `&vcoord_nml remap_method` and
  `&ocean_diag_nml diag_remap_scheme`); `N<5` silently falls back to PPM
  (documented design, not a configure-time error — the canonical
  `double_gyre_mom6.nml` runs `nz=2`, so selecting `pqm` there is PPM).
  PQM's own boundary cells still collapse to PCM (the 4×4 cubic-fit upgrade
  above applies to PQM too — deferred, a kernel change not a wiring one).
  The remap (and the Fox-Kemper fold) are **gated on the
  thermo cadence** (`dt_therm_ratio`, MOM6 DT_THERM): every outer step at the
  default `ratio=1` (bit-identical), once per thermo interval at `ratio>1`
  (Lagrangian-then-remap, conservative; the Lagrangian state is valid for the
  fixed-z diag output and bit-exact for restart via the saved `outer_step_count`).
  Horizontal tracer advection is NOT yet on the coarser cadence — the deferred
  flux-accumulation phase decouples `DT_TRACER_ADVECT` next.
- **Along-coordinate tracer Laplacian** (`&ocean_hdiff_nml kappa_h`,
  default `0.0` = off): constant-coefficient conservative curvilinear
  flux-form diffusion on `T = hTr/h`, thickness-weighted faces. Diffuses
  along the MODEL coordinate, not neutral surfaces — on a σ/z* grid over a
  slope that has a diapycnal component (accepted; `&ocean_redi_nml` is the
  separate neutral path). Physical-edge wall closure (not array-edge) —
  correct under both single-rank all-wall and MPI-decomposed runs.
  Configure-time guard (`rdb_ocean_stability_audit.F90`, part of the
  stability audit below) aborts on `κ_h·dt_therm·(1/dx_min²+1/dy_min²) >
  0.5`, using the REAL per-cell metric minimum on any grid type (fixed
  from an earlier Cartesian-only, nominal-`dx`/`dy` check that silently
  skipped spherical/tripolar grids).
- **Configure-time stability audit** (`rdb_ocean_stability_audit.F90`,
  runs once per solver creation, after the real metric arrays are built)
  — named-number, named-fix diagnostics for the failure modes that used
  to surface only as a bare `[nan-catch]` count mid-run: (1) viscous CFL
  `nu_h·dt/dx_min² > 0.125` (ERROR unless `bound_kh`/`stress_tensor` is
  enabled, in which case informational only — the runtime clamp already
  protects it); (2) the `kappa_h` diffusive number above (ERROR); (3)
  Munk sidewall boundary-layer resolution `delta_M >= 2` cells (WARNING);
  (4) `&ocean_hvisc_nml ah_max < nu_h` silently clamping the configured
  viscosity (WARNING). All four use the ACTUAL minimum grid cell
  (`ocean_stability_min_cell`), never nominal `&grid_nml dx`/`dy`
  (degrees on spherical/tripolar), and checks (1)-(2) take that minimum
  over WET cells only — on the 1° tripolar grid the smallest cell anywhere
  is a 362 m land cell at a land-locked bipole, which used to abort a
  configuration whose ocean was inside the bound. The companion runtime diagnostic
  (`apply_velocity_truncation`'s NaN-catch, `rdb_ocean_dyn.F90`) reports
  the `(i,j,k)` of the first non-finite face plus the local cell size and
  viscous CFL there, gated behind the existing catch so it costs nothing
  on a healthy run.
- **Tracer packages** — `multilayer_state_t%register_passive_tracer(grid,
  name, units, long_name, idx)` (6-arg; `idx=0` on refusal, `registry_locked`
  after `enter_data`) grows the S+T[+age] registry at setup; every
  passive-transport kernel (advection, ALE remap, vertical exchange,
  vertical/horizontal diffusion, Redi, sponge, halo/fold, OBC ghost +
  reservoirs, restart) already loops the registry, so a newly-registered
  tracer rides them for free — only a named EOS/surface-flux coupling and a
  diag `fill_<name>` (the ocean diag surface is NOT registry-driven) need
  hand-wiring. Budget attribution (`heat_budget_*`/`salt_budget_*`) is a
  registry property (`tracer_t%budget_id`), not an index coincidence — a
  passive tracer defaults to no budget slot. Shipped packages: **ideal age**
  (`&ocean_tracers_nml enable_ideal_age`, MOM6 `USE_IDEAL_AGE_TRACER`
  analogue — 1 s/s interior aging, surface reset) and **pseudo-salt**
  (`&ocean_tracers_nml enable_pseudo_salt`, Shao 2016 verification tracer —
  seeded to S, given exactly S's surface salt flux + KPP/EPBL non-local
  mirror; the deviation `pseudo_salt − S` measures the passive-vs-active
  transport-path error; fail-loud excluded from SSS restoring + sea-ice,
  both un-mirrored salinity sources). Both default off ⇒ bit-identical.
  Deferred: a namelist-declarable arbitrary dye/CFC/BGC package (needs a
  generic registry-driven diag-fill path, not just the registration API).

### Shipped — coordinates + BCs + I/O

- **All ten VCOORD_* families** dispatch through the same ALE remap:
  `LAGRANGIAN`, `EULERIAN_Z`, `SIGMA`, `ZSIGMA`, `ZSTAR`, `ZSTAR_FULL`,
  `ZSTAR_SIGMA`, `Z_FIXED`, `RHO`, `HYCOM` (enum of record:
  `src/core/rdb_constants.F90`). Eight are `select case` branches of
  `ocean_vcoord_compute_target_h`; `RHO` and `HYCOM` need per-layer T/S plus
  the EOS and so enter through the sibling `compute_target_h_rho`, dispatched
  from the same remap driver (`src/ALE/rdb_ocean_remap.F90`). `LAGRANGIAN`
  early-returns — the target IS the live `h_layer`, so the remap is a no-op.
  On the ocean path `ZSTAR` shares the `SIGMA` branch: in this barotropic
  `(H, η)` form the two target formulas are the same expression.
  `RHO` is validation-grade alone (weakly-stratified columns collapse);
  `HYCOM` is the production hybrid.
- **`HYCOM`'s z\* floor is in METRES** (2026-10-02, audit finding H1; MOM6
  HYCOM1 parity). Interface `k` is kept at least `Σ dz·(H+η)/H` deep (clamped
  to the bed), with `dz` the z\* coordinate resolution of `&vcoord_nml
  z_fixed_profile` — the same table `z_fixed` builds its levels from:
  `"uniform"` = `max_depth/nz_layers` m (the default), `"list"` / `"tanh"` a
  stretched profile (e.g. 2 m at the surface). Before, the floor was
  `Σ dsig·(H+η)` with `dsig ≡ 1/nz` (nothing ever wrote another `dsig`): a
  column FRACTION, i.e. a sigma floor. On the 1° Southern Ocean (WOA13 IC,
  offline census `python_prototypes/hycom_fix/hycom_floor_census.py`) it set
  95.4 % of all interfaces and 96 % of the interior ones (floor depth
  200 m..bed), so `hycom` was terrain-following there and died like sigma on
  the `rx0 = 0.99` shelf break. With the tanh floor and a WOA13 sigma-2
  volume-quantile target list (`rho_target_profile = "list"`,
  `rho_target_list`) the floor sets 16 % of the interior interfaces —
  density sets the rest. With the old uniform linspace targets
  (1033.5..1037.3) the floor still sets > 99 % of the interior: the targets,
  not only the floor, have to fit the water masses. What it does NOT fix: a
  shallow column's deeper interfaces now clamp onto its bed, so bed-side
  layers collapse to the `2·H_VANISHED` inflation floor along every slope,
  and those collapsed layers take the full PGF (no vanished-layer / closed-face
  treatment off `z_fixed` — audit finding H2). **So with the metres floor,
  collapsed bed layers form along every step on `hycom`, and until the
  vanished-layer PGF treatment (H2) lands, `hycom` on stepped topography
  hits the open-staircase PGF defect** — the same one `z_fixed` without
  `zfixed_closed_faces` has. Measured: `vcm_rx0_040_hycom` (tier 1, V100)
  stays XFAIL but now aborts at outer step 23 on the remap guard with
  `h = −15.9 m` (it aborted at step 24 with `−6.8e-5 m` under the old sigma
  floor). The negative layer is in the SOURCE thickness the dynamics hand the
  regrid, not in the target: at the 450 m | 1050 m step a 77 m layer faces a
  collapsed `3e-4 m` one, the PGF there grows from `4e-14` to `880 m/s` over
  steps 1-19, and continuity drives the layer negative. The floor sweep itself
  never produces a sub-floor or non-conserving column (gate
  `test_ocean_vcoord_hycom :: hycom_floor_stress_sweep`, 25 344 columns).
  Only an unconfigured slot
  (`z_fixed_h_ref <= 0`, i.e. a unit test that builds the vcoord by hand) still
  uses the column-fraction floor.
- **Per-family status under a DISPLACED COLUMN TOP** (a rigid lid — an ice
  shelf — at `z = −z_top` instead of `z = 0`). The target builder is handed a
  column *thickness* and nothing else
  (`ocean_apply_ale_remap_centres`, `src/ALE/rdb_ocean_remap.F90`), so it cannot
  know where the column starts. Measured interface-by-interface by
  `tests/test_ocean_vcoord_interface_depths.F90` on a 500 m live column under a
  lid at `z = −500` over a 1000 m bed:

  | Family | Under a displaced top | Gate |
  |---|---|---|
  | `LAGRANGIAN` | **Correct** — no geometric target at all (the remap is a no-op); datum-free | `lagrangian_builds_no_target` |
  | `EULERIAN_Z` | **Correct** — a stretched sigma with η dropped, *not* a geopotential coordinate despite the name; divides the live column proportionally | `eulerian_z_under_a_lid_divides_live_column` |
  | `SIGMA` | **Correct** — terrain-following at both ends; the live column divided proportionally. With `Z_FIXED`, the only families the cavity accepts today, and the control leg of the coordinate study | `sigma_under_a_lid_divides_live_column` |
  | `ZSTAR` (MOM6 z\*) | **Refused under a cavity** — dilates its nominal profile from the free surface; MOM6's rigid-top branch is not ported. (It was the sigma branch, and accepted as such, until 2026-10.) | `zstar_eta0_is_z_fixed`, `zstar_dilates_profile_static_pattern` |
  | `ZSTAR_SIGMA` | **Correct** — a purely fractional rescale of the global table, so datum-invariant. Safe, and useless for a cavity: it follows *both* boundaries | `zstar_sigma_under_a_lid_divides_live_column` |
  | `ZSIGMA` | **Refused on the ocean path** — see the `z_ref_global` limitation below | `documents_zsigma_dimensionless_zref_collapse` |
  | `Z_FIXED` | **WRONG** — the nominal stack hangs from the column top wherever that top is, so the fillers land on the **bed** and the live stack under the lid. A z-like coordinate wants the mirror image (fillers under the top, live layers at their open-ocean depths); the per-index error reaches **500 m** at `e(5)` (measured `−1000.0` m, analytic `−500.0` m) | `documents_z_fixed_anchored_at_column_top` |
  | `ZSTAR_FULL` | **WRONG, and worse** — the reference table is built from the TRUE bed while the walk is handed the live thickness, so `eta_loc < 0` on every covered column and the table's SHALLOW entries are kept. It does not merely anchor at `z = 0`, it INVERTS which half of the column is resolved: measured with a 20 m fine band, the band lands at `z = −500 … −560` (hard against the lid, 500 m too deep) and the deep water is carried by 134 m coarse layers, with the fillers on the bed | `documents_zstar_full_band_anchored_at_z0` |
  | `RHO` / `HYCOM` | Density-space: no geometric anchor, so draft-agnostic. HYCOM's z\* nominal-floor band accumulates from the column top, so under a lid that band is draft-following — defensible, but it is **not** a z-like band and should not be quoted as one | `test_ocean_vcoord_rho`, `test_ocean_vcoord_hycom` |

  The `documents_*` rows assert the CURRENT placement on purpose: the suite is
  green and the defect is pinned. The rigid-top slice must flip them.
- **Which coordinate is trustworthy on which GEOMETRY — the rest-state
  matrix and the v0.1.0 rx0 ENVELOPES.** The per-family placement table above
  says where a family puts its interfaces; it does not say what the resulting
  run *does*. The vertical-coordinate **rest matrix**
  (`tests/regression/vcoord_matrix.py`) runs ONE problem — a motionless,
  stably stratified f-plane ocean with the isopycnals flat in geopotential
  `z` — under **every** family on **eleven** geometries (flat; a slope; a
  Gaussian seamount at two steepnesses; a single-face stiffness ladder at
  `rx0 = |dH|/(H_a+H_b)` = 0.1/0.2/0.4/0.6/0.8; a flat and a sloping ice lid),
  in **two legs**: INVISCID (the hard probe) and VISCOUS (MOM6's shipped
  seamount closure translated: `&ocean_hvisc_nml nu_h = 160, stress_tensor =
  .true.` — the same `KH/Δx²` as MOM6's `KH = 1000` at 5 km — and `&ocean_bdrag_nml
  form = "linear", r = 1e-5, hbbl = 10`, i.e. MOM6's `CDRAG·DRAG_BG_VEL =
  1e-4 m/s` stress). It gates the spurious energy's level and fitted growth
  rate, the budgets at round-off, the tracer bounds, positivity and the
  remap precondition guard. Both legs run **the configuration v0.1.0
  recommends over sloping topography**: `&ocean_pgf_nml form = "fv_mom6",
  reconstruct_for_pressure = .true.`; `&vcoord_nml remap_boundary_extrap,
  remap_nonuniform_weights, remap_check_preconditions = .true.`; and
  `zfixed_closed_faces = .true.` for `z_fixed`. Re-measured 2026-09-23 with
  the MOM6-parity defaults (`&ocean_bt_nml bebt = 0.1`, `&ocean_continuity_nml
  renorm_consistent_flux = .true.`) together with the vanished-layer content
  rule I1′, on gfortran 15.1 (CPU) and nvfortran 26.5 (V100), 30 simulated
  days per cell; **both toolchains agree on every verdict** (FINDING C below, the one GPU-only
  difference, is fixed).

  **The envelope** — the largest measured geometry `rx0` at which every
  viscous cell of the family passes every gate on both toolchains (the
  measured rungs are 0, 0.0071, 0.0138, 0.030, 0.078, 0.1, 0.2, …):

  | family | v0.1.0 envelope (viscous) | inviscid, every gate passes to | what caps it |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `sigma` | **rx0 ≤ 0.8** (top of the measured ladder) | 0.078 | nothing measured (FINDING B, which capped it at 0.078, is fixed by the default) |
  | `zstar` (MOM6 z\*, closed faces) | **not yet re-pinned** — the row measured `sigma` under another name until 2026-10; it now runs the `z_fixed` staircase dilated per column, with closed faces | — | re-measure (`vcoord_matrix_pin.py`) |
  | `zstar_sigma`, `zstar_full` | **rx0 ≤ 0.8** (top of the measured ladder) | 0.1 | nothing measured (was 0.1, FINDING B) |
  | `eulerian_z` (pins `ssp_rk2`) | **rx0 ≤ 0.8** (top of the measured ladder) | flat only | nothing measured (was 0.6) |
  | `lagrangian` | **rx0 ≤ 0.8** (top of the measured ladder) | 0.8 | nothing measured (was 0.03: the grounded-layer PGF gate zeroed massive non-overlapping layers over a step; it requires a vanished side since 2026-10-04) |
  | `z_fixed` (closed faces) | **flat only** | flat only | salinity overshoot at the regrid (`tracer:no-new-extrema`) wherever layers vanish; the salt/heat leak is fixed (I1′, budgets at round-off in every cell) |
  | `rho`, `hycom` | **flat only** | flat only | FINDING A (viscous), the rest-state mode (inviscid) |

  Outside its envelope a family is not claimed to rest. Every terrain-following
  family rests at machine zero (`En ≤ 9.1e-21`) on the slope, both seamounts
  and the sloping ice lid in both legs, and the viscous leg on every ladder rung — the 3e-09 … 2.7e-04 plateaus of the
  pre-fix table are gone. The INVISCID leg's growth on the ladder is
  **documented expected behaviour**: MOM6 (dev/gfdl `d74a11f9c`) grows the
  same mode out of round-off on its own sigma seamount at rest, e-folding
  0.81–0.85 d independent of rx0 0.10–0.76, zero on a flat bed, absent at
  `f = 0`; its shipped closure kills it. Three FINDINGS, localised, not tuned
  away (details and substitution tables in
  [`tests/regression/README.md`](../tests/regression/README.md#findings--what-the-two-legs-turned-up)):
  **B** (FIXED by the 2026-09-22 defaults) — under `pred_corr` a stepped
  terrain-following column grew an explosive barotropic grid-scale mode (in the matrix: with the
  viscous leg's closure, after 2–28 days). LOCALISED to the continuity's
  barotropic transport renormalisation, not the viscosity: its Newton flux
  model is discontinuous where a layer's upwind donor flips across a
  thickness jump, has no root when `uhbt` falls in the gap, and returns a
  wrong-sign layer transport, so the layer free surface leaves the
  barotropic one at the step every other step. Seeded, it grows inviscid,
  at `f = 0`, at `dt = 300 s` and on one layer; `ssp_rk2` and `&ocean_bt_nml
  bebt ≥ 0.05` (MOM6's default is 0.1) out-damp it. **Fix:**
  `&ocean_continuity_nml renorm_consistent_flux = .true.` (MOM6
  `zonal_flux_adjust` parity; **the default since 2026-09-22**, together with
  MOM6's `&ocean_bt_nml bebt = 0.1` fast-loop damping — it is bit-identical
  wherever no donor flips; `.false.` restores the historical model). **A** — `stress_tensor = .true.` drives a density-space
  (`rho`/`hycom`) column negative within 4–8 steps on any slope (the scalar
  operator rests it; MOM6's `hrat_min` thin-layer bound is the missing
  safeguard, a hypothesis). **C** (FIXED, e8a1ab68d) — on the GPU only, every
  `rho`/`hycom` run with `eos = "wright"` faulted (`CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS`)
  in `ocean_vcoord_compute_target_h_rho_impl` at the first regrid, flat bed
  included; an `associate` name passed to the device EOS routine carried a
  host address. Markers and envelopes are pinned by `vcoord_matrix_pin.py` from
  both toolchains' runs into `vcoord_matrix_measured.py`, never by hand; the
  CI (tier 2) carries the viscous leg on the in-envelope geometries.
- **`VCOORD_ZSIGMA` is REFUSED at configure** (`&vcoord_nml vcoord_type =
  'zsigma'`), on the ocean path, with or without a cavity. Its deep branch reads
  `z_ref_global` as a table of absolute reference depths **in metres**
  (`z_top_k = min(z_ref_global(nz-k), column_total)`), but the only writer of
  that array anywhere in `src/` is the **dimensionless** `z_ref_global(k) = k/nz`
  init in `ocean_vcoord_init` — nothing on the namelist path, the Python path or
  the benchmark path ever replaces it. So every z-level interval is `1/nz`
  *metres*: on a 1000 m column with `nz = 10`, nine layers of 0.1 m stack in the
  top 90 cm and the remaining 999.1 m is dumped into the **bed** layer by the
  deficit line. `Σ target_h = H + η` stays exact throughout, which is exactly why
  no conservation test ever caught it and why the family shipped looking healthy;
  the collapse is measured interface-by-interface in
  `test_ocean_vcoord_interface_depths :: documents_zsigma_dimensionless_zref_collapse`.
  No shipped namelist selects it. **Follow-up:** fill `z_ref_global` in metres —
  ZSIGMA is the natural seat for a sigma-near-the-top / z-below hybrid — then
  delete the refusal and the `documents_*` case with it. `VCOORD_ZSTAR_SIGMA`
  consumes the same table *fractionally* (rescaled by `z_ref_global(nz)`) and is
  therefore unaffected by the units and stays accepted — but note that with a
  uniform table its "z\*-lite in deep water" branch is numerically
  indistinguishable from `SIGMA`, so the 21 shipped namelists that select it are
  running sigma.
- **`&vcoord_nml zstar_h_min > H_VANISHED` is REFUSED** on the geometric
  (INERT-role) families `ZSTAR_FULL` / `Z_FIXED` — promoted from a warning. On
  those families the knob is the anti-zero thickness of filler layers that are
  *meant* to read as vanished downstream; above the D4 skip/merge marker they
  become dynamically live (EOS, PGF, remap drain, vdiff) while the coordinate
  still treats them as throwaway. The boundary is a strict `>`: the five shipped
  namelists that set exactly `1.5e-4` are legal and unaffected. The density
  families (`RHO` / `HYCOM`) carry the opposite, keep-alive contract on the same
  knob (`max(zstar_h_min, 2·H_VANISHED)`) and are not policed by this rule.
  A density-family column too thin to hold every layer at that floor
  (`H + η < nz·max(zstar_h_min, 2·H_VANISHED)` — every land column, which
  holds `nz·H_VANISHED`, and any dry sliver) is **not regridded**: it keeps
  its layers, so the remap is the identity there. Before 2026-10-02 the
  inflation step debited the whole floor deficit from the one surviving
  layer (a 50-layer land column went to `−7.2e-3` m — the step-3 crash of
  the 1° Southern Ocean `rho` run) or, when no layer survived, set every
  layer to the floor and minted water; and a column just thick enough
  whose thickest layer could not pay the debit alone went negative too —
  that case now shares the debit across every above-floor layer. Gate:
  `test_ocean_vcoord_rho :: thin_column_*`.
- **OBC dispatch wired end-to-end** (2026-06-10, `&ocean_bc_nml` →
  per-edge tags → driver → kernels). Shipped types: WALL (default),
  OPEN (Flather + per-layer zero-gradient baroclinic anomaly), TIDAL
  (multi-constituent η), CLAMPED (Dirichlet η/u/v + per-tracer inflow
  values), CHAPMAN (scalar edge-mean Orlanski), SPONGE (a closed WALL
  at the outer face — every no-normal-flow closure reads the tag through
  `ocean_bc_outer_face_tag` — plus an interior band of momentum decay
  and optional tracer relaxation via `sponge_relax_tracers`), and
  **PERIODIC** (per-axis ghost-wrap reentrant boundary; requires
  `nghost >= 3`, paired edges; bit-exact seam — a circularly shifted
  IC reproduces the shifted solution bit-for-bit). NESTED behaves as
  OPEN pending the parent-data orchestrator; INFLOW/DISCHARGE are
  tag-reserved only. Open-edge tracer ghosts are upwind-aware
  (inflow uses the per-edge boundary value, outflow zero-gradient),
  or — with `res_lscale_in/out` — evolve through per-face **tracer
  reservoirs** (implicit relaxation between interior and boundary
  data at flow-dependent rates; no sign-switch chatter). Radiating
  edges optionally use **per-layer Orlanski radiation**
  (`radiation_scheme="orlanski"`, running-mean phase speed,
  `rx_max` clip) with asymmetric inflow/outflow **nudging**
  (`nudge_tau_in/out`), and the barotropic Flather supports the
  **full half-characteristic form** with exterior velocity
  (`flather_form="full"`, per-edge `*_ext_u/v`). Boundary-corner
  relative vorticity is zeroed at every non-periodic edge.
- **Horizontal grids** (`&ocean_grid_nml grid_config`): `cartesian`
  (default), `spherical` lon-lat sector, `supergrid` (MOM6 mosaic
  reader), and **`tripolar`** — Murray (1996) bipolar Arctic cap above
  `phi_join` + lon-lat below, closed by a **north fold**
  (`north="tripolar_fold"`, requires periodic west/east). The fold
  reverses-i + sign-flips vector normals + antisymmetrically projects
  the duplicated fold-line row — for roundabout's SOUTH-face v /
  SW-corner storage that is row `ng+nj+1`, the north face of the last
  T-row (index maps derived in the `rdb_ocean_fold` header) — and the
  final meridional mass flux on that row, so the cross-fold exchange
  telescopes to round-off (`tripolar_cross_fold_conservation_*`). The
  fold line is a SEAM, never a north wall: the barotropic fast loop
  updates its `vbt` and corner vorticity like an interior face. Metric +
  `f_corner` ghosts are folded once at configure. Kernels read full 2D
  metric arrays only.
  **Cap poles:** when `lon_pole` (or `lon_pole + 180`) falls on a node
  column, every cap node of that column is placed exactly on the pole,
  so the pole-column Cu face and the pole corners are EXACTLY zero
  (a closed face, `iareaBu = 0`) — never a round-off sliver
  (`tripolar_pole_columns_exact`; before, the partner pole's ~1e-9 m
  face drove ~1e3 m/s at step 1 on coarse caps and on the 1-degree
  global grid). WHICH pole column landed exactly was libm luck: under
  nvfortran `-fast` the `lon_pole = 0` column's periodic image at
  pseudo-longitude 360 was the sliver where gfortran's was exact, so
  every compat-matrix tripolar cell failed on the GPU build only
  (`rdb_test_ocean_tripolar_determinism` runs that geometry twice: bounded,
  and bitwise identical ghosts included). A zero-width face is CLOSED by the land-mask pass
  (`wet_u = 0` wherever `dy_cu = 0`, likewise `wet_v`/`dx_cv`) even
  though both of its cells are wet, so a WET node-aligned pole is
  supported under both split schemes
  (`tripolar_zero_width_faces_closed`,
  `tripolar_wet_pole_pred_corr_no_growth`). Before, the open pole face
  kept a prognostic velocity whose `pred_corr` time mean was never
  updated, and the fast-loop Coriolis reference read it frozen: En 0.66
  m²/s² by day 30 on the compat-matrix tripolar domain (sigma), 3.2e-3
  after — matching an off-node `lon_pole` (3.2e-3); `ssp_rk2` there
  went 4.7e-3 → 3.2e-3.
  **Decomposition:** every split is supported and bit-identical to the
  single-rank run (`rdb_test_ocean_tripolar_fold_mpi`, 1/2/3/4 ranks — h, u,
  v, S, T, η, the wet mask and the configure-time metrics, ghost rows and
  columns included; `rdb_test_ocean_decomp_bitid_mpi`'s `tripolar` case,
  every restart field). Only the north rank row folds (`bc%north_fold` is
  rank-local); every other rank's north ghosts are an MPI seam. On a
  north-south split (`px = 1`, the auto-factor default) the north rank
  holds the whole fold row and folds locally. On an east-west split
  (`px > 1`, explicit `&mpi_nml px`) the fold runs through an owner-routed
  exchange over the north rank row (`rdb_ocean_fold_plan` +
  `rdb_ocean_fold_exchange`): every north-ghost and fold-line value is sent
  by the rank that OWNS its mirror point, the sign is applied on receipt,
  and the fold-line projection stays a copy of the east-half value — so no
  arithmetic has to agree across ranks. Cost: in the barotropic fast loop
  it adds two small exchanges per substep (η + ubt after the mid-substep u
  exchange, vbt before the time-mean accumulators), about as much as the
  existing per-substep halo group on a latency-bound (sub-OM4_025) V100
  case; the baroclinic sites add one grouped exchange each. The analytic
  `tripolar` generator cuts each tile out of the whole grid (a transient
  global-size metric set per rank at configure). Refused at configure: a
  north tile shorter than `nghost + 1` rows (`ny/py`) and, under `px > 1`,
  a tile narrower than `nghost + 1` columns (`nx/px`).  The `supergrid`
  (mosaic) reader is windowed per rank (see *MPI (domain decomposition)*),
  so the MOM6 OM_1deg grid runs split north-south too.
  The `supergrid` reader applies the SAME ghost-metric topology as the
  analytic `tripolar` (`metrics_fold_periodic_ghosts`) whenever the edge
  tags say periodic-x and/or `tripolar_fold`, spans the periodic seam
  faces across the seam (`sg_dx(2ni) + sg_dx(1)`), and fails loud when
  the tags disagree with the file (a mosaic IS tripolar iff its top node
  row folds onto itself, `m ↔ 2ni+2−m`). The grid rotation is read into
  `metrics%angle_dx` (radians at T, MOM6's `angle_dx` convention:
  the grid +i axis counter-clockwise from true east; from the mosaic's
  `angle_dx` when present, else from the node geography — and always
  from geography on the analytic tripolar). Nothing consumes it yet:
  rotating lat-lon vector forcing onto the grid
  (`u_grid = cos·u_E + sin·v_N`, `v_grid = −sin·u_E + cos·v_N`) is the
  in-model regrid's job, and until then vector forcing files must be
  pre-rotated. Vector→geographic output rotation at the seam is
  deferred (output shows model-frame velocities in the cap). Known
  limit: the analytic `tripolar` top row is a fold by INDEX only — its
  index conjugates sit on meridians 180° apart, not on the same point —
  so it cannot be written out and read back as a `supergrid`.
- **Static geometry is seam-consistent from the moment it exists.**
  Every bathymetry source (NetCDF file, API-staged array, formula
  setters) is periodic-wrapped and north-folded inside the IC seed,
  before any field is derived from it, and the PGF's own bathymetry
  copy (FV-MOM6 / gprime) is taken after the engine's init-time halo
  pass. A constant-extrapolated seam ghost used to reach that copy — a
  spurious seam jet on file-bathymetry periodic grids (1.9 m/s within
  3 h on the 1° global grid); gated by `test_ocean_periodic_seam_file`
  (shift invariance under an `nx/2` roll).
- **Diag manager**: registry + cadence + procedure-pointer fill
  dispatch. Default device-resident fills for `SSH, T, S, u_centre,
  v_centre, KE`; CONSERVATIVE vertical remap onto fixed-z
  (`DIAG_VGRID_Z_FIXED`), sigma, z*, or density bins (`DIAG_VGRID_DENSITY`,
  **namelist-reachable**: `&ocean_diag_nml vgrid="density"` + `rho_levels`/
  `n_rho_levels`, or per-diagnostic `name:density`/`name:rho` in `diags`;
  configure-time guard requires `n_rho_levels > 0` and strictly increasing —
  density bins have no auto-fill, unlike sigma/z*) —
  donor-cell overlap integral via the shared `remap_column` kernel,
  intensive + extensive variants, density targets reusing the RHO
  `invert_density_targets` solve; time-ops INSTANT / MEAN / MAX / MIN /
  **INTEGRAL** (`name:integral` — cumulative `Σ(sample·dt)` over the cadence
  window, undivided; the budget-closure operator, distinct from MEAN);
  serial per-rank NetCDF emit (CF-1.8). `&ocean_diag_nml diags` requesting
  a canonical diagnostic whose feature gate is closed (e.g. `age` with
  `enable_ideal_age=.false.`, `ice_conc` with the ice off) now
  `logger%warning`s naming the diagnostic and the likely gate, instead of
  silently dropping it — `name:off` stays a silent no-op either way.
- **Restart / checkpoint** (bit-exact, MPI-native registry):
  per-slot restart registry (`restart_registry_t`) — every
  prognostic-owning slot registers its arrays at state-build time, the
  manager (`ocean_state_restart_write` / `_read`) walks the registry
  with the `!$acc update self` device-pull discipline (device-mapped
  entries only), writes each field as a full local array (interior +
  ghosts), and writes a per-rank `restart_rank_NNNNNN.nc` durably
  (`.tmp` + POSIX-rename) with decomposition + grid/vcoord/tracer +
  schema metadata, validated on read. Checkpoints barotropic
  (`h, u_face_x, v_face_y`), multilayer (`h_layer, u/v_face_x/y_layer`,
  every `tracers(:)%hTr`, `rho_layer` — carried across dt_therm-skipped
  steps), KPP lagged `bl_depth`, EPBL `mld`+`kd_int` and kappa-shear
  `kd_int`+`tke_int` (merged every stage, refreshed only at thermo
  cadence — so required for bit-exactness), the live BC persistent state
  (Chapman `eta_old_chapman_*` scalars + tracer reservoirs `tres_*` when
  allocated), and `outer_step_count` (dt_therm alignment). A missing
  REQUIRED field on read is fatal. Resume requires the SAME
  decomposition + matching grid/vcoord/tracer metadata (errors loudly on
  mismatch — fatal when the driver omits `ierr`); cross-rank
  redistribution is a future offline tool. Driver-wired at
  `cfg%restart_interval` cadence + clean end; warm-start from
  `cfg%restart_file`. Bit-exact step-(N+1) roundtrip gate:
  `test_ocean_restart` (closed-wall + periodic-x seam + physics-rich
  KPP/heat-flux/dt_therm + decomp-mismatch negatives via both the check
  path and the production read wrapper), green on GPU. Sea-ice EVP
  dynamics is covered too: the ice->ocean momentum mediation
  (`surface_stress%tau_x/y`) is carried on the ice slot
  (`ice_tau_ocn_x/y` + the `ice_tau_ocn_valid` presence scalar, both
  `optional=.true.`) and COPIED back at configure by
  `ice_ocean_stress_resume_apply` — formula-agnostic by construction,
  replacing an earlier reconstruct-from-checkpointed-concentration fold
  that was NOT bit-exact whenever a checkpoint step's thermo/transport
  changed ice concentration after the blend. Gate:
  `restart_bit_exact_ice_evp` (`tests/test_ocean_ice_restart.F90`),
  alongside `restart_fresh_run_is_pure_wind` (no restart file ⇒ pure
  wind, not a zeroed stress) and `restart_old_checkpoint_degrades_to_wind`
  (a pre-this-capability checkpoint resumes with a documented
  one-window cold-start of the τ mediation, not a fatal). Diag
  MEAN/MAX/MIN windows reset on restart by design. The dead
  `ocean_obc_t` scaffold is NOT checkpointed (never enabled /
  device-mapped); OBC registers its own live state when it lands.
- **Initial conditions**: analytical ICs (uniform / linear-T(z) /
  Eady-front / geostrophic-adjustment / per-layer `gprime` density)
  plus the **geopotential T(z)/S(z) overlay** (`&ocean_zinit_nml
  enable`, capability A2), which has two sources.

  `source = "file"` (the default) reads T/S from NetCDF. The file must
  be **pre-regridded to the model horizontal grid** (`nx_phys ×
  ny_phys`, bathymetry-loader precedent); A2 does the in-core vertical
  step — linear-in-depth interpolation of `temp`/`salt` onto the seeded
  layer-centre depths with constant extrapolation beyond the source
  z-range, written as `hTr = value · h_layer`. Dry columns
  (`wet_mask ≤ 0`) get the namelist `land_fill_t/_s` constants; the
  ghost rows keep whatever the analytical IC seeded, because the file
  carries no data for them. Source `temp` is taken as the prognostic T
  directly.

  **`land_fill_t/_s` is INERT on interior land cells, and always was.**
  `ocean_state_seed_land_cells` runs after every IC overlay and applies
  the land-state contract (`h_layer = H_VANISHED`, `hTr = 0`), so the
  fill values do not survive into the state. Before that contract was
  made explicit they survived the seed but not the first ALE regrid,
  which zeroes a land column's tracer content at the vanish gate — so
  the knob's reach was one step, and only into a budget total it had no
  business being in. It is kept because the reader still needs a defined
  value to write for a dry column, and because a column that is dry in
  the FILE but wet in the model geometry is a real case the fill does
  reach.

  `source = "linear"` needs no file: it evaluates the affine profiles
  `T(z) = lin_t_ref + lin_dt_dz·z`, `S(z) = lin_s_ref + lin_ds_dz·z`
  (**`z` positive UP**, zero at the `z = 0` datum — the
  `&ocean_ic_nml eady_dT_dz` convention; a stable column has
  `lin_dt_dz > 0` and `lin_ds_dz < 0`) at every layer centre's true
  geopotential depth, and — being analytic — fills the FULL array
  including ghosts and land columns. This is the profile an idealised
  ice-shelf cavity or ISOMIP+-style case needs: `&tracer_nml
  T_init_surface` / `T_init_bottom` (and their `S_init_*` twins) are
  linear in LAYER INDEX, so under a terrain-following coordinate with a
  SLOPING lid they tilt the isopycnals with the coordinate, which is
  not a state of rest.

  Both sources measure depth from `z = 0`, so under
  `&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml` the column-top offset `metrics%z_draft` is
  passed through and the profile lands at the right geopotential depth
  (before P5.3 the two were refused together, because the overlay
  measured from the column top and so sat `z_draft` metres too
  shallow). Default off (`enable=.false.`) ⇒ analytical IC
  bit-identical, and `z_draft = 0` reproduces the no-draft answer
  bit-for-bit (`test_ocean_zinit :: zinit_draft_bitident`).

  **Not yet shipped:** on-the-fly horizontal regrid + nearest-wet land
  flood-fill (MOM6 `horiz_interp_and_extrap` half — deferred to a
  Python preprocessor + v2), and conservative (cell-integral-
  preserving) vertical remap (v1 uses point linear interp at layer
  centres; the first ALE remap re-grids anyway). The whole overlay,
  `source = "linear"` included, lives in the NetCDF-gated
  `rdb_ocean_z_init` and so needs `RDB_ENABLE_NETCDF=ON` even when it
  opens nothing.

### Sea ice

**A high-quality sea-ice dynamical core and column model, not yet a
sea-ice model.** SIS2 port under `src/core/ice/` (14 modules, ~6,900
lines; ~6,400 lines of tests), gated by `&ocean_ice_nml enable` (default
off ⇒ the slot is never initialised, mapped, or stepped ⇒
byte-identical). The physics that is there can be trusted; the physics
that is missing is most of the ice mass budget. Limits first:

- **No ridging.** `compress_ice` (`rdb_ice_transport.F90`) is a
  thinnest-first cascade that returns `part_size(0) ≥ 0` by in-place
  compaction/promotion — mass- and area-conserving, but it thickens ice
  **in its own category** at zero energetic cost. That is not a ridging
  parameterisation: no participation function (which thin ice deforms),
  no redistribution function (where the deformed mass goes), no work
  done against gravity. **It is SIS2's own `DO_RIDGING=.false.`
  fallback** — SIS2's `compress_ice`/`else` branch (`SIS_transport.F90`)
  is the identical routine and role, and SIS2 itself calls it *"a
  minimalist version of a sea-ice ridging scheme."* Roundabout matches
  SIS2's shipped default and is missing SIS2's option, which is itself
  an Icepack wrapper (`ice_ridge.F90`), not native SIS2 code — porting
  it means vendoring Icepack, not a small follow-up. Consequence: under
  convergence, ice thickens uniformly instead of building a thick
  ridged tail — the ITD is wrong in a convergent regime (too little ice
  in the thick categories), and because the EVP ice strength
  `pres_mice = (p0/ρ_ice)·exp(−c0·max(1−ci,0))` reads that distribution,
  the strength is biased with it. This bites hardest exactly where EVP
  matters most: convergent, near-shore, and Antarctic-shear regimes.
- **No snowfall source.** `m_snow` is allocated, transported, melted,
  and rebalanced — and can only ever *decrease* (zero occurrences of
  `snowfall`/`fprec`/`precip` under `src/core/ice/`). Consequence: the
  snow machinery is present but effectively unreachable outside a
  restart — the CSIM4 snow-vs-bare-ice albedo blend
  (`rdb_ice_optics.F90`), the snow-covered melt point, and the snow/ice
  interface conductivity never fire on a cold-start run.
- **No snow-ice flooding.** No freeboard or submergence calculation
  anywhere in `src/core/ice/` — the mass module docstring
  (`rdb_ice_mass.F90`) states freeboard/flooding mass paths are
  "deliberately NOT ported." Consequence: where snow load depresses the
  freeboard below sea level, flooding (snow → snow-ice conversion) is
  unrepresented; in the Antarctic this is a large fraction of total ice
  mass.
- **No melt ponds.** `m_pond = 0.0_wp` is a hardwired dead local in
  `rdb_ice_column.F90`, kept only so the surrounding branch matches
  SIS2's shape — there is no pond state on `ocean_sea_ice_t`.
  Consequence: summer melt is biased low and the melt-albedo feedback
  is absent; the CSIM4 melting-albedo ramp is a crude stand-in, not a
  representation of ponds.
- **No lateral melt / floe-size effects.** Surface and basal melt only
  (zero occurrences of `lateral_melt`/`floe` under `src/core/ice/`) —
  MIZ retreat is biased.
- **No ice initial-condition path.** No IC namelist group, no reader —
  ice can enter a run only by frazil growth from an ice-free ocean, or
  by restart.
- **Coupling is partial.** Salt is closed (virtual brine-rejection
  flux, Boussinesq — the ocean's water mass is not reduced). Heat is
  closed, including the transmitted shortwave `sw_thru` (shortwave
  penetrating the ice into the ocean below): PR 31 reduces the
  per-category `sw_thru` to a per-cell field and `ice_ocean_sw_flux`
  (`rdb_ice_ocean_coupler.F90`) delivers it to the ocean — into the
  `q_sw` surface-flux component when `&ocean_forcing_nml
  enable_components` is on (assembled into `Q_heat`), else added
  directly into `Q_heat`. The v1 divergences from SIS2 that remain:
  the ocean's own background shortwave is not lead-fraction weighted by
  ice cover (the configure-time `q_heat`/`q_sw` scalars stay ice-blind),
  and the ocean shortwave is single-broadband (no `VIS_DIF`-style
  spectral band assignment). Momentum reaches the ocean as the
  concentration-weighted blend of the wind snapshot and the EVP
  ice-ocean drag (`ice_ocean_stress_flux`), and that blend also
  refreshes the derived cell-centred `|tau|`
  (`ocean_surface_stress_refresh_mag`), so the boundary-layer schemes'
  friction velocity `u_* = sqrt(|tau|/rho0)` follows the ice-mediated
  stress instead of the configure-time wind — under full ice cover in a
  windless run the pre-fix `u_*` was identically zero
  (`test_ocean_ice_stress_mag`). Momentum is still **not conserved at
  fractional ice cover**: the ice feels the full wind-stress snapshot
  rather than a concentration-weighted bulk drag law (documented
  divergence D7, `rdb_ice_evp.F90`). There is **no freshwater/mass
  coupling at all** (`rdb_ice_frazil_uptake.F90`: "Freshwater/mass
  coupling is PR-3c+ territory") — ice carries no weight, so it applies
  no dynamic sea-surface loading.
- **Frazil is surface-layer-only.** The supercooling clamp/bank
  (`rdb_ice_frazil`) checks only the top layer (`k=nz`); MOM6/SIS2
  check the full water column for supercooled water.

**Shipped** (each independently validated):

- **Winton (2000) two-layer column thermodynamics + enthalpy**
  (`&ocean_ice_nml enable`, `nk_ice=2`) — brine-salinity-dependent,
  energy-conserving, Stefan-verified to <1% relative at days
  1/5/10/30 over a 32-day hourly integration.
  `test_ocean_ice_column`, `test_ocean_ice_enthalpy`.
- **Multi-category ITD restore** (`ncat>1`) — whole-category shift, not
  Lipscomb (2001) remap (SIS2 doesn't ship that either — its "remap" is
  a `SIS_transport.F90` TODO comment, never code). `test_ocean_ice_itd`.
- **Category ice/snow transport + `compress_ice`** (`&ocean_ice_nml
  transport`) — category-summed PPM (reuses `rdb_continuity`) with a
  proportionate per-category flux split and PCM tracer riding.
  `test_ocean_ice_transport`.
- **C-grid EVP rheology** (`&ocean_ice_nml dynamics`) — full elliptical
  yield curve, replacement pressure with a grid/Tdamp-scaled floor,
  device-resident subcycled loop, correct C-grid staggering; golden-
  tested against the analytic Nansen free-drift solution
  `|u| = √(τ/(ρ_ocean·c_dw))` to 15 digits. With `dynamics=.false.` ice
  velocity falls back to sampling the ocean surface layer.
  `test_ocean_ice_evp`.
- **Frazil bank + uptake** and **ice → ocean coupling** (salt closed;
  heat closed, incl. transmitted shortwave `sw_thru`, PR 31) —
  `test_ocean_frazil`, `test_ocean_ice_coupling`,
  `test_ocean_ice_driver_column`, `test_ocean_ice_diags`.

**Envelope.** The ice runs on the ocean's domain decomposition (same
tiles, same `nghost`), bit-identical to one rank
(`test_ocean_decomp_bitid_mpi`, case `sea_ice`): the category state is
halo-exchanged at the end of every thermo block and at cold start, the
EVP ice velocity at the top of every subcycle and once after the loop,
the transport's cell-averaged masses and riding tracers at the top of
every advective substep (with the zero-velocity early exit and the
positivity / compress abort flags made rank-uniform), and the blended
ice->ocean stress through the ocean's own surface-stress seam refresh
(`rdb_ice_evp` D6, `rdb_ice_transport`, `ocean_halo_exchange_ice_*`).
Restarts round-trip bitwise through the production engine path, on one
rank (`test_ocean_restart_engine`, ghosts included) and decomposed (the
write/resume leg of the bit-id ice cases); the cold-start category
exchange is never run on a warm start (the checkpoint carries the
writer's ghosts). On
ONE rank the same calls close a periodic seam, so `transport` now runs
with periodic edges and a periodic + `dynamics` run no longer reads stale
category ghosts there (an answer change against older builds on such
configurations). Still refused: the ice with `north="tripolar_fold"` on
more than one rank (the ice fields are not folded), and `dynamics` with a
tripolar fold at all;
`dynamics` with any OBC/tidal/sponge/clamped/Chapman edge — there is no
open-boundary support for ice at all.

### Deferred (planned, not yet shipped)

- **Nonlinear collapse of the Eady front** (`validation_examples/ocean/eady/`,
  2026-09-13) — past day ~65 the `dT_dy = -2e-5` front's eddies pass 1 m/s,
  hit the 2 m/s `maxvel` clamp and NaN-catch by day ~75 at dt = 600 s
  (`n_inner` 20 and 30, clamp removed, `nu_h = 100` all fail); dt = 300 s
  survives to day 100 but with `En` above the front's available potential
  energy. The shipped 60-day window is the validated linear phase.
- **Resting-state growth at low Laplacian viscosity** (same dir, open) — a
  motionless, stably stratified periodic channel seeded with ±0.5 mK
  white-noise T grows `En` from 0 to 3e-5 m²/s² in 25 days at `nu_h = 0`
  (Smagorinsky + `nu_4 = 5e8` on; broadband in x, smooth bed/surface-
  intensified vertical structure, e-folding 2.5 days, and the resting T
  range shrinks 0.5 K at each end). `nu_h = 20` lowers the level 230× at
  day 25 but not the rate; `nu_h = 100` holds it at 1.6e-11. Not yet
  attributed to a kernel.

- **Hollingsworth-Källén Coriolis correction** — Arakawa-Hsu 4-corner
  weighted-PV stencil; the PV form is current production.
- **Full KPP Phase 2+** — `V_t²` unresolved-turbulence term in the
  bulk-Ri sweep + full non-local γ_T/γ_S transport + bottom BL
  extension.
- **Smagorinsky and biharmonic lateral kernels** declared with enums
  (`LMIX_SMAGORINSKY`, `LMIX_LEITH_BIHARM`, `LMIX_BIHARMONIC`);
  Smag_KH + Smag_AH are live; Leith biharmonic is the next item.
- **Non-hydrostatic on the C-grid** — hydrostatic only today; a
  non-hydrostatic pressure correction on the C-grid layout is
  unimplemented.
- **Tides** — equilibrium + SAL ship (`&ocean_tides_nml`); OBC-tide
  nodal correction ships (`&ocean_bc_nml obc_tidal_nodal`). Internal-tide
  drag on the barotropic mode ships too, but as a SEPARATE capability —
  `&ocean_bt_nml wave_drag` (barotropic linear/Rayleigh wave drag, Egbert
  & Ray 2001 / Jayne & St Laurent 2001), independent of `&ocean_tides_nml`
  and Cartesian-compatible. Its `r_H(x,y)` map is `form="uniform"` (a
  global scalar) or `form="roughness_proxy"` (a resolved-bathymetry-
  variance PLACEHOLDER for the real subgrid `⟨h²⟩`, not a substitute for
  it); `form="file"` (a real subgrid-roughness map) is registered but
  fails loud at configure — the NetCDF reader is PR-14.
- **MPI I/O server hand-off** for diag manager (serial NetCDF is
  the current emit path).
- **Per-layer Orlanski phase-speed radiation** at open edges (v1
  ships Flather mean + zero-gradient baroclinic anomaly) and
  file-backed / tidal-table boundary data sources (the polymorphic
  `update(t, bc)` call site is wired in the driver; only the
  constant backend ships).

### Validation surface

`validation_examples/ocean/` carries the canonical benchmarks:

| Subdir | What it tests |
|---|---|
| `seamount/` | Quiescent IC over Gaussian seamount; zero motion forever; caught three latent ocean bugs in May-21. |
| `geostrophic_adjustment/` | Rossby SSH bump on f-plane; IG-wave radiation at √(gH); 2π/f oscillation at centre. |
| `eady/` | Baroclinic instability of a thermal-wind front in a periodic channel; the kx = 2 (125 km) channel mode grows at 1.93e-6 1/s vs 1.98e-6 from Eady (1949) theory (re-baselined 2026-09-13: `dT_dy = -2e-5`, `nu_h = 20`, 60 days). Linear-growth benchmark only — see the nml header for why the run stops before the front's nonlinear collapse. |
| `eddy_test/` | Stratified wind-driven β-plane double-gyre; WBC + eddy shedding. |
| `double_gyre/` | MOM6 ocean_only/double_gyre reproduction; stable 580+ days. |
| `neverworld2/` | Idealized single-basin (Marques et al. 2022): 60°×140° spherical sector, re-entrant southern (Drake) channel, MOM6-inspired continents + banded zonal wind. v1 = geometry bring-up (wind-only, linear-T EOS, zstar+KPP); SST-restore + thermocline IC are fast-follows. |
| `baroclinic_channel/` | Eady/Phillips baroclinic instability in a periodic-x channel; the clean, fast, well-resolved eddy-generation test (growth → roll-up → saturation, conservation, bounded CFL). 2-layer (~3 min) + 15-layer demo. |
| `island_at_rest/` | Quiescent basin with an interior land block; stays exactly at rest (zero motion, mass-exact) — the land-mask Tier-1.5 trap. |
| `flow_past_island/` | Wind-driven flow onto an island; verifies no-normal-flow (velocity ≡ 0 inside land) + mass conservation. |
| `double_drake/` | Ferreira et al. 2010 two-continent world (seam-straddling meridional walls + reentrant southern channel); land-masking showcase. |
| `sea_ice/` | Polar freeze-up: `polar_freezeup_thermo.nml` (column + frazil + brine) and `polar_freezeup_dynamics.nml` (EVP drift) — physics-sanity runs, not a performance benchmark. |
| `isomip_plus/` | ISOMIP+ Ocean0/1/2 (Asay-Davis et al. 2016) — 240×40 @ 2 km, 36 sigma layers, analytic MISMIP+ bedrock, ice-shelf cavity + basal melt, far-field 3-D restoring. **Configuration deliverables, not validated results**: they pass `validate_config` and run, the parameter map is auditable row-by-row in the directory README, and nothing is tuned to a melt rate. The blockers to a publishable Ocean0 (virtual salt flux only, untuned Γ_T, no-slip walls unavailable, the sloping-lid rest-state growth mode) are listed there. `ocean0_idealised_draft.nml` runs end to end with no external data. |

(Ocean knobs split into per-concern sub-namelists as of the
namelist-UX refactor — `&ocean_<group>_nml` with the `ocean_`
prefix dropped from each key.  Run `tools/nml_split.py <file>` to
migrate an old `&ocean_setup_nml` namelist.)

This is the regime that hits day 580 on the MOM6-ref double-gyre.
Outside this envelope (lower `nu_h`, alternative drag form, alternative
PGF on real bathymetry) needs case-by-case validation.

#### Quiescent terrain-following runs over a slope need a CONSTANT viscosity floor

A σ (or z*σ) column at rest over a sloping boundary, on an f-plane, with
`ny ≥ 2` and no constant lateral viscosity, develops a **grid-scale
2Δy computational mode in `u`** that grows exponentially and does not
saturate. Measured on an ice-free 48 × 6 × 15 channel at 2 km, flat free
surface, bed sloping linearly 226 → 709 m, linear EOS, T linear in z, no
forcing, no drag, no mixing, `pred_corr`, `form="fv_mom6"`:

| | plateau (d5–15) | day 45 | day 90 | fitted `σ_En` (d25–45) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| default PCM density integral | 6.4e-10 | 1.6e-6 | 3.3e-5 | 0.31 /day |
| `reconstruct_for_pressure=.true.` (exact PGF) | 1.0e-25 | 1.3e-20 | 1.7e-13 | 0.38 /day |

Two facts follow, and they point in different directions:

* **The pressure-gradient truncation error is only the SEED.** With the
  in-layer reconstruction on, the static σ PGF error is at round-off
  (see the FV-MOM6 reconstruction row of `docs/CLOSURE_MATRIX.md`) and the
  plateau drops **15 decades**. That buys ~55 days of horizon on this
  configuration and nothing more.
* **The AMPLIFIER is a separate defect and is NOT in the pressure
  gradient.** The fitted growth rate agrees to ~25 % with a round-off seed
  and with a 1e-8 m/s² one, and it is unchanged (0.9 %) by the Coriolis
  variant. It **requires rotation** (`f = 0` ⇒ no growth), it **gets faster
  as `dy` is refined** (0.35 /day at `dy = 2 km`, 0.54 /day at 1 km — a
  rate that rises without bound under refinement has no continuum limit),
  and it **disappears when the per-step ALE remap onto the σ target is
  switched off** (`vcoord_type="lagrangian"`, where the remap is an
  early-return no-op: 0.05 /day, i.e. the same residual creep as `f = 0`).

**Which part of the remap — and the knob that removes it.** Isolated by
substitution on the same configuration: the face-velocity (momentum) leg is
**inert** (skipping it entirely moves day-45 En by 0.1 %, 1.714E-20 vs
1.712E-20, and the remap's ΔKE is a *negative* 1e-11 of column KE per
call). The interior reconstruction order is **irrelevant** — `plm`, `ppm`,
`ppm_h4` and `pqm` give `σ_En` = 0.353, 0.355, 0.355, 0.354 /day. What is
left is the **boundary-cell closure the four share**: `k=1` and `k=nz`
reconstruct as PCM (MOM6 `BOUNDARY_EXTRAPOLATION = False`), so the remap is
first-order in exactly the two layers the mode occupies, and every step
injects a spurious diapycnal tracer flux there. Per-remap energetics
confirm the direction: ΔPE is **positive at every sample** and grows in
lock-step with the mode (3.2E-16 → 1.2E-13 J/kg per call, days 5 → 45)
while ΔKE is four to eight decades smaller and negative. **Setting
`&vcoord_nml remap_boundary_extrap = .true.`** — the linear-exact one-sided
closure — collapses the growth to the no-remap floor: `σ_En` 0.355 → 0.047
/day, day-45 En 1.712E-20 → 4.745E-25, against 0.046 /day and 1.5E-25 with
the remap switched off entirely. Default `.false.` ⇒ bit-identical; see the
boundary-cell-closure block of `docs/CLOSURE_MATRIX.md` and
`test_remap_boundary_extrap`.

**Practical envelope.** Any long, quiescent, weakly-forced terrain-following
run over a slope — a spin-up from rest, a sub-shelf cavity, a continental
slope at rest — should set `&vcoord_nml remap_boundary_extrap = .true.`
and, failing that (or under `remap_method = "pcm"`, where the knob is
inert), carry a **constant** `&ocean_hvisc_nml nu_h` or `nu_4` floor.
Marginal viscosities measured at 2 km on this family: `nu_h ≈ 50 m² s⁻¹`
or `nu_4 ≈ 1e8 m⁴ s⁻¹`. The viscous requirement grows as `dy` shrinks and
is not yet measured as a function of resolution; the boundary-closure fix
has no such scaling because it removes the source rather than damping it.

**Flow-aware closures do NOT qualify.** Smagorinsky, Leith,
Leith-biharmonic and Smagorinsky-AH all set their coefficient from the
resolved deformation rate or vorticity gradient, which is zero in a fluid
at rest: at onset the mode is a µm/s perturbation and these closures
generate essentially no viscosity exactly when it is needed. A forced,
energetic, viscous run sits decades above this floor and never notices; a
quiescent one does not, and there the manufactured energy IS the signal.

## Conservation contract (console Mass / Salt / Heat `Error`)

The periodic `[stats]` console block prints a `Mass : <total>  Error <residual>` line for each conserved quantity.  The `Error` meaning depends on the regime and the run configuration.

### What the `Error` measures

For a conserved quantity Q the residual is

```
Error = (Q_total - Q_ref) + out_Q - src_Q
```

where `Q_ref` is the value latched on the first status report, `out_Q` is the cumulative net outflux through open boundaries (positive = left the domain), and `src_Q` is the cumulative surface source (positive = added to the domain).  On a conservative, closed-domain, unforced run all three terms are zero and `Error` is the true numerical-leak residual **subject to the summation-order floor described below**.  With open boundaries or surface forcing the budget correction keeps `Error` a round-off residual rather than a spurious flag for the intended physics.

When a budget term is not instrumented (see limitations below) the console falls back to raw drift `(Q_total - Q_ref) / Q_ref`, byte-identical to the pre-budget behaviour.

### The summation-order floor, and the `reproducing_sums` escape hatch (PR-32)

**Since v0.1.0 `reproducing_sums = .true.` is the DEFAULT**, so the console is identical on every rank count (1 included).  With `reproducing_sums = .false.` (the pre-v0.1.0 behaviour) every `Q_total` above is a plain floating-point `!$acc parallel loop reduction(+:acc)` device reduction, combined across ranks by `MPI_SUM` on doubles.  Neither is associative or order-deterministic: a changed rank count, a changed domain decomposition, or a changed GPU reduction-tree shape can all change the last few bits of `Q_total` — and `Q_ref` is latched as a `real(wp)` (double), so even a perfectly exact sum feeding an unchanged `(Q_total - Q_ref)` subtraction would still be quantised to ~1 ulp of `Q_total` (for a basin-scale `Q_total ~ 1e21`, that ulp is ~1.3e5 in absolute units — precisely the band the `Error` column is asked to resolve).  Two consequences of turning it off:

- **`Total mass` / `Total KE` / `Total salt` / `Total heat` are NOT rank-count-reproducible** with `reproducing_sums = .false.` — the printed totals drift at round-off (~1e-14 to 1e-15 relative) when the decomposition changes, even for bit-identical physics.
- **The `Error` floor is set by summation noise, not physics**, at that same ~1e-14 to 1e-15 relative band.

`&ocean_diag_nml reproducing_sums = .true.` (the default) routes `Total mass` / `Total KE` / `Total salt` / `Total heat` (and the sea-ice area totals) through an Extended-Fixed-Point (EFP) reproducing sum (Hallberg & Adcroft 2014; `src/framework/rdb_efp.F90` + the comm-facade `halo_allreduce_efp_list`, ONE collective in place of the default path's several separate `MPI_SUM` calls) and forms the `Error` residual by differencing in FIXED POINT (`efp_real_diff`) rather than subtracting two already-quantised doubles.  With it on:

- The printed totals become **bit-identical across rank counts and reduction/decomposition orders** (EFP's decomposition is a pure function of each summand's value; integer bin addition is exact and order-invariant, modulo the bounds below).
- The residual floor drops to the EFP quantum (`2^-3P` per summand, aggregated `<= N * 2^-3P` over `N` cells) — around `1e-54` relative against a `~1e21` total, i.e. the floor becomes irrelevant to any physically-meaningful drift rather than merely "exact".
- **Rank envelope**: `EFP_MAX_RANKS = 2^(53 - 36) = 131072`.  The cross-rank combine transports the six fixed-point bins as exactly-representable `real64` values (there is no `integer(int64)` MPI allreduce in `pic_mpi_lib`), which is exact only while every partial sum a rank count could form stays `<= 2^53`; both this bound and the per-summand bin-1 bound are enforced fail-loud (`error stop`), never a silent fallback.  131072 ranks is far beyond any Roundabout run.
- The knob changes diagnostic TEXT only, never the prognostic trajectory.  `.false.` restores the pre-PR-32 console byte-for-byte.
- **Cost**: the EFP totals run only when the console fires (the status cadence); the one per-step piece is the mass `out` accumulator (a 2-D EFP reduction of each column's divergence, formed in a fixed k order).  Global 1-degree grid (360 x 320 x 50), one V100, daily status: 25.77 s vs 25.63 s of stepping for two days (**+0.5 %**); with a status report every step, about 0.05 s per report.
- Scope: the primary totals feeding `Error` (Mass/KE/Salt/Heat + sea-ice area) AND the salt/heat closed-budget `out`/`src` terms (the boundary-outflux and surface-source corrections above) go through EFP, so every printed number is decomposition-independent.  The mass `out` term is accumulated per step in EFP bins as well; only the cavity-only mass `src` (a single-rank path) stays an FP running sum. `compute_max_cfl` is untouched by this knob in either branch: a global max is already exact and order-invariant in floating point, so there is nothing to fix.

### Instrumented paths

| Regime | Mass | Salt | Heat |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ocean (`sim_type='ocean'`, split RK2) | closed residual | closed residual | closed residual |
| Ocean (`sim_type='ocean'`, unsplit) | closed residual | closed residual | closed residual |

Windowed tracer advection (`&ocean_vmix_nml dt_tracer_advect_ratio > 1`) is
instrumented too, since 2026-09-12: `continuity_tracer_drain`'s sub-cycle and
BOTH halves of the per-stage concentration hold accumulate into the same
`*_budget_horiz_adv` arrays, so the closed residual holds at every report, not
only on window boundaries.  It used to fall back to raw drift, which cannot
subtract a source — a conservative run with a surface heat flux then reported
the heat the flux legitimately added as a ~5e-5 "leak" (four shipped
`acc_channel` namelists; now ~3e-14).

Redi neutral diffusion with an OPEN edge is instrumented too, since
2026-10-02. The neutral flux crosses the open face against the OBC-filled ghost
column, as it does in MOM6 (`neutral_diffusion` gates its faces on
`G%mask2dCu`, which an open segment's normal face keeps at 1).
`redi_apply_flux` books its realised increment into `*_budget_hdiff`, so the
exchange lands in `out` and the residual closes to round-off. Before that, the
console fell back to raw drift whenever Redi met an open edge. Raw drift
reported the advective boundary exchange itself as a ~4e-5 "leak" in 24 steps,
even with `khtr = 0`. The compatibility matrix found it (`redi_obc_salt_budget`).

### Known limitations (fall back to raw drift)

None at present. The `horiz_adv_budget_valid` gate in `ocean_budget_is_active`
remains for the next un-instrumented transport path.

## What Roundabout is not

- **Not a semi-implicit free-surface model.** The split-explicit barotropic sub-cycling gives O(minute) outer steps, but that is sub-cycling the fast mode, not treating the gravity-wave term implicitly in the SCHISM/Casulli sense. There is no implicit η-solve on this tree.
- **Not a wave model, and not non-hydrostatic.** The dynamical core is hydrostatic; there is no phase-resolving surface-gravity-wave capability, no wave-maker / absorbing BCs, and no external wave-model (SWAN/WW3) coupling.
- **Not a coastal / estuarine shock-capturing solver.** Dam-break, hydraulic-jump, tidal-bore and inundation work lives in the separate coastal repository — the Riemann/KNP machinery is not in this tree.
- **Not a BGC model.** No biology source terms, no FABM coupling.
- **Not a sediment / morphodynamic model.** Bathymetry is fixed.
- **A high-quality sea-ice dynamical core and column model, not yet a
  complete sea-ice model.** Winton column thermodynamics, the
  multi-category ITD, category transport + `compress_ice`, C-grid
  EVP dynamics, an analytic ice initial-condition path, a snowfall
  source term, and Archimedes snow-ice flooding are landed (default off,
  `&ocean_ice_nml`) and independently validated (Nansen free-drift to 15
  digits, Stefan melt to <1%) — see the "Sea ice" subsection above for
  the full limits list. The physics that is there can be trusted; the
  physics that is missing is most of the ice mass budget: no ridging
  (`compress_ice` is SIS2's own `DO_RIDGING=.false.` fallback, not a
  participation/redistribution scheme), no melt ponds, and no lateral
  melt. Snow-ice flooding (`snow_ice`) carries a known SIS2-inherited
  approximation — the converted ice takes the SNOW's enthalpy and zero
  salinity rather than the flooding SEAWATER's, so it is too cold and
  too fresh; true seawater-based flooding (ocean mass/heat/salt sink
  from refreezing pore water) is a materially larger, deferred closure.
  Coupling is partial (transmitted shortwave `sw_thru` is now coupled
  to the ocean — PR 31; ice<->ocean
  momentum conserved at fractional cover only with the opt-in
  `&ocean_ice_nml a_face_stress` — the default-off legacy form leaks
  `(1-a)(tau_a-fxoc)` per face, no freshwater/mass exchange), and the
  whole slot is fail-loud single-rank.
- **Not a fully equipped basin-scale climate ocean model — yet.** The
  ocean path (`sim_type='ocean'`) is now operational for regional /
  basin hydrostatic configurations (see the "Ocean path" section
  above), but is missing tides, SAL correction,
  and the Hollingsworth-Källén Coriolis guard that production
  climate-scale models rely on. Eddy-resolving regional ocean (Tasman
  2 km, MOM6-ref double-gyre) works today; ice-coupled global climate
  doesn't.

## Compiler / platform support

- **NVHPC** (GPU + multicore stdpar) — primary target, exercised in CI.
- **gfortran** — exercised in CI for portability.
- **ifx** — buildable; some OpenMP-target map-clause edge cases observed in vendor tooling, not load-bearing for the canonical NVHPC build.
- **AMD / Intel GPUs** — unsupported today (no HIP / SYCL backend; would be a portability research project).

## How to read this alongside the roadmaps

The roadmap (`ROADMAP_OCEAN.md`) carries the full work checklist with project-scope tags (`[E]/[M]/[H]/[V]`) and `Validate:` lines per planned item. This document summarises the *current* state; if there's a discrepancy, the codebase is the authority and the roadmaps are the next-best source.
