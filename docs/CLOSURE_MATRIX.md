# Roundabout — Closure & Scheme Matrix

**Single source of truth for "which closure / scheme is enabled in which
regime."** When you add, port, or remove a closure, **update the relevant cell
in the same PR** — `tools/check_closure_matrix.py` (pre-commit/CI) fails the
build if a namelist closure knob has no row here, or a listed test is missing.

Cell convention: a cell holds the **namelist knob** that enables the scheme in
that regime (so the matrix doubles as "how to turn it on"), or `default` (active
unless another is chosen), or `—` (not available in that regime).

This build ships the **ocean** regime only (`sim_type='ocean'`, Arakawa C-grid);
the coastal A-grid / unstructured path was split out into its own repository.
Ocean knobs live in `&ocean_<group>_nml` (the `ocean_` prefix is dropped from
each key); the shared vertical/tracer config lives in `&nonhydrostatic_nml` and
`&vcoord_nml`.

disagree, **the code is authority and this file is a bug** — fix it.

Last reconciled with the code: **2026-10-05** (PR-3, visc_rem chain audit + unification, revised the same day once MOM6 settled the BT-correction-fold question: ONE `&ocean_bt_nml visc_rem_chain` switch — the visc_rem producer (decoupled from the retired `correction_visc_rem`) plus `forcing_visc_rem` + `renorm_visc_rem` + `bt_rem_from_visc_rem` together, never a superset, each now self-sufficient; `strong_drag`/`rescale_strong_drag` stay separate keys (their own MOM6 params). **`correction_visc_rem` is RETIRED**: MOM6's `accel_layer_u` (`MOM_barotropic.F90:3665-3675`) gives every layer the SAME `u_accel_bt`, no `visc_rem` weight, folded into `up` BEFORE `vertvisc` distributes it via the glue's own implicit friction — ONCE, not twice; roundabout's weighted BT-correction fold did it a second time with an unbounded `vr_k/⟨vr⟩_h` ratio, which is what NaN'd the 1-degree Southern Ocean z* open-step case under `bbl_glue` at step ~40 (isolated by A/B probes; fixed by making the fold UNIFORM under the chain, matching MOM6). `forcing_visc_rem`'s `wt_u` weight now runs MOM6's EXACT floor (`MOM_barotropic.F90:1082-1101`: cap at 1, floor at `1 − 0.5·Instep/(vr+subroundoff)`, floor at 0, `ieee_is_finite`-guarded) instead of a plain `[0,1]` clamp, threaded through `set_cor_ref_velocity` too. `&ocean_vdiff_nml accel_visc_rem` is RETIRED — no MOM6 state-update equivalent (`btstep_layer_accel` applies `u_accel_bt` uniformly across layers); the real MOM6 `visc_rem*velocity` mechanisms are `renorm_visc_rem` and `rescale_strong_drag`. MOM6's `accel_layer_u` also ALWAYS adds the depth-mean-zero `pbce` baroclinic term (every PGF form); roundabout only adds it under `correction_bc_pgf` + `form='fv_mom6'` — a reported, unfixed, general fidelity gap, unrelated to the NaN. The `av_rem`/`forcing_visc_rem` depth means still use roundabout's own plain two-cell-mean `frhat`, not MOM6's HVEL_SCHEME default (HYBRID, arithmetic/harmonic blend) — a reported, not yet ported, divergence; see the PR-3 audit), and **2026-10-05** (PR-2, bt-rem-from-av-rem: `&ocean_bt_nml bt_rem_from_visc_rem`/`strong_drag`/`rescale_strong_drag` — `bt_rem_u/v` from the frhat-weighted depth mean of `visc_rem` instead of the linear-piston `substep_drag` law, MOM6 `MOM_barotropic.F90:1553-1580`; new row in the Outer time-split scheme table), and **2026-10-04** (the FV-MOM6 PGF reads a vanished layer's T/S as its I1′ donor concentration instead of the floored `hS/H_VANISHED`, which open z-like steps integrated across the face; the `sadourny_hk` pair floor also runs on OPEN staircases of `z_fixed` / `zstar` / `zstar_full`), and **2026-10-01** (`&ocean_bt_nml upstream_h_face`, `substep_drag` and `wave_drag` ported to the OPEN column under `&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces` — the upstream face depth was the full upstream column and NaN-ed the 1-degree Southern Ocean; the two drag refusals are lifted, `correction_bc_pgf` stays refused; `k_bot`, the bed-side first-live-layer index: bottom drag, the implicit-fold rate + vdiff bed row, geothermal, the tidal-mixing bed anchor, the MEKE bed speed and the bed-reaching shortwave now sit on the first LIVE layer counting up from the bed; and the velocity BIHARMONIC — scalar `nu_4` and the flow-aware `smag_ah` / `leith_biharm` — honours `&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces`: the partial-step row gains it as a consumer and `nu_4 > 0` leaves its refusal list, `stress_tensor` stays; earlier: 2026-09-27 (per-EOS cost pass: the FV-MOM6 in-situ PCM PGF under Roquet evaluates the SpV polynomial's (T, S) part once per Boole sub-column, the in-situ passes run one GPU thread per cell, and the `reconstruct_for_pressure` branch reuses the columns' own `dpa` as its cross-face end points (15 EOS evaluations per face, was 25) and runs a handle-free Wright twin — the two PGF rows' costs restated; earlier the same day: the FV-MOM6 in-situ PCM PGF under Wright evaluates MOM6's CLOSED-FORM `int_density_dz_wright` layer integral instead of a 5-point Boole quadrature of the generic EOS — the in-situ PGF row's method, cost and tests restated; earlier: 2026-09-25 (`&ocean_pgf_nml insitu_density`, default ON: the FV-MOM6 constant-by-layer PGF evaluates its density at the in-situ pressure, MOM6 `int_density_dz_generic_pcm` — a PGF row added and the `in_eos` refusal list extended; earlier the same day: `&ocean_bt_nml bc_pgf_forcing`, default ON: the barotropic substep is forced by the depth-mean baroclinic PGF, MOM6 `BT_force`/`eta_PF` — the split-scheme section gains its row and the two load rows that relied on the old depth-mean replacement are restated; earlier: 2026-09-23 (the v0.1.0 `z_fixed` × cavity envelope: `&ocean_pgf_nml reconstruct_for_pressure` newly REFUSED there, and a configure WARNING for `&ocean_hvisc_nml nu_h < 2`; earlier: 2026-09-22 (MOM6-parity defaults: `&ocean_bt_nml bebt` 0 → 0.1 and `&ocean_continuity_nml renorm_consistent_flux` → `.true.`; earlier the same day: `&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces` now REFUSES `&ocean_bt_nml correction_bc_pgf` / `substep_drag` / `wave_drag`, the three barotropic paths still on full-column weights; `substep_drag` under a non-linear `&ocean_bdrag_nml form` WARNS; `apply_bt_correction` takes `metrics` as a REQUIRED argument.

## Vertical mixing (3D / multilayer only — no-op at nz=1 and in 2D)

| Closure | ocean | Numerics | Primary test |
|---|---|---|---|
| PP81 (Pacanowski–Philander Ri) | `default` | implicit (backward-Euler tridiagonal) | `test_ocean_pp81` |
| KPP (Large et al. 1994) | `use_kpp` (Phase 1) | overlay on PP81; surface buoyancy flux `B_0 = (g/ρ₀)·(α_T·F_T − β_S·F_S)` with `F_T = Q_heat/(ρ₀·c_p)`, `F_S = Q_salt/ρ₀` — the `1/ρ₀` is load-bearing because `α_T`/`β_S` are the DIMENSIONAL linear-EOS sensitivities (kg m⁻³ per °C / PSU), and it is the same number EPBL forms as `g·ρ₀·(dSV/dT·F_T + dSV/dS·F_S)`; persisted per column as the diagnostic `vmix%b0` (mirror of `epbl%b0`); `B_0` shortwave method `&ocean_thermo_nml kpp_sw_method` (all_sw/mxl_sw/lv1_sw, PR-21) | `test_ocean_kpp*`, `test_ocean_buoyancy_flux`, `test_ocean_sw_bl_coupling` |
| EPBL (Reichl & Hallberg 2018 energetics) | `&ocean_epbl_nml enable` | implicit; closed-form energy solve; replaces the KPP overlay, combines with PP81 (`add`/`max`); penetrating-SW TKE ledger `&ocean_thermo_nml epbl_sw_ctke` (PR-21) | `test_ocean_epbl`, `test_ocean_sw_bl_coupling` |
| kappa-shear (Jackson, Hallberg & Legg 2008 prognostic shear) | `&ocean_kappa_shear_nml enable` | per-column coupled (κ, TKE) Picard solve + adaptive substepping; INTERIOR closure — additive with KPP/EPBL/PP81, thermo-cadence compute, every-stage merge; opt-in VERTEX form (`at_vertex`, MOM6 VERTEX_SHEAR / OM5) solves at C-grid corners from native face velocities and averages corner Kd back to tracer points (arithmetic or `vertex_geometric_mean` + `vertex_geomean_kdmin` floor); Kv routed corner→face (`prandtl_turb·kd_corner` via `vdiff_apply_momentum kv_corner_source`, MOM6 `Kv_shear_Bu` — cell-centred kv merge suppressed in vertex mode) | `test_ocean_kappa_shear` |
| tidal mixing (St-Laurent/Simmons internal-tide, Jayne & St Laurent 2001 / St Laurent et al. 2002 / Simmons et al. 2004) | `&ocean_tidal_mixing_nml enable` | bottom-intensified `Kd = q·μ·E·F(z)/(ρ·(N²+Ω²))`, exp decay from the bed (scale ζ; "the bed" is `ms%k_bot`, the first live layer, so a `z_fixed` filler column reads `N_bot` across its two deepest LIVE layers and the fillers take no Kd), conservative flux bookkeeping; INTERIOR closure — additive with KPP/EPBL/PP81/kappa-shear, thermo-cadence compute, every-stage merge; E prescribed (v1) or `E=½ρ₀κ⟨h²⟩U²·N_bot` (Jayne & St Laurent 2001, `e_compute`) | `test_ocean_tidal_mixing`, `test_ocean_zfixed_k_bot` |
| convective adjustment (Brunt-Väisälä trigger, CVMix `CVMix_convection` / Cox 1984 / Marotzke 1991) | `&ocean_conv_nml enable` | `N² < n2_thresh` (interior interface, dense-over-light) ⇒ `kt = max(kt, kd_conv)`, `kv = max(kv, prandtl_conv·kd_conv)`; INTERIOR closure applied BELOW the active KPP/EPBL boundary layer; CONTRIBUTOR (max floor), runs every stage before `vmix_assemble`; `kd_conv` default 1.0 m²/s (~100× PP81's own Ri<0 ceiling) admissible only because vdiff is backward-Euler; writes `kv`/`kt` only, never `ks` (see CAPABILITIES_AND_LIMITATIONS.md) | `test_ocean_convection` |
| background mixing (Bryan & Lewis 1979 depth profile **XOR** Henyey, Wright & Flatte 1986 latitude factor) | `&ocean_vmix_nml bkgnd_profile` **xor** `bkgnd_henyey` | Two MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE replacements for the SCALAR `kt_bg`/`ks_bg`/`kv_bg` assembly floor (enabling both fails loud at configure, matching MOM6's one-background-scheme rule). **`bkgnd_profile`**: per-interface `kd_bg(z) = kd_sfc + (kd_deep−kd_sfc)·[½+atan((\|z\|−z0)/Δ)/π]` recomputed each stage from the live column thickness (correct under any vcoord); `kv` floor = `bkgnd_prandtl·kd_bg`. **`bkgnd_henyey`** (Harrison & Hallberg 2008 constant-`N0` simplification; requires a non-cartesian `grid_config`, fail-loud at configure — `geolatT ≡ 0` on cartesian so every column would take the equatorial `L(0°)=0`): scales the SCALAR TRACER floors by a latitude-only factor `L(φ)` and floors the result, `max(bkgnd_kd_min, kt_bg·L(φ))` (MOM6 `KD_MIN`; negative `bkgnd_kd_min` ⇒ `0.01·kt_bg`). Knobs `bkgnd_henyey_n0_2omega`/`bkgnd_henyey_max_lat`, defaults 20/95°, clamp compared against `\|φ\|` so both hemispheres; equator singularity floored via a fixed `1e-10` `\|sin φ\|` guard inside the `acosh` ratio only, so `L→0` smoothly and the `Kd_min` floor is what the background lands on. `kv_bg` is NOT latitude-scaled (rdb's momentum floor is independent of `kt_bg`, not `prandtl·Kd`). FLOOR contributor into `vmix_assemble`'s (b) stage, replacing (not combining with) the scalar background when on. Both default off ⇒ bit-identical | `test_ocean_bkgnd_mixing` |

Notes: ocean vmix is **implicit** (backward-Euler tridiagonal). The
two-equation k-ε closure and the Galperin/Canuto stability functions were
coastal-path closures and left with that split; the GLS-generic family (k-ω /
MY2.5) is **not** built.

**Ocean diffusivity assembly (`vmix_assemble`, C11).** On the ocean path every
interior / overlay closure (PP81, KPP, EPBL, kappa-shear, tidal mixing,
KV_ML_INVZ2, convective adjustment) **contributes** into `kv`/`kt`. `ks` (the salt diffusivity) is not
a contributor target — it is **derived** from `kt` by `vmix_split_kd_heat_salt`
(MOM6 `Kd_salt = Kd_int + Kd_extra_S`, PR-20), which runs after the last
contributor and immediately before `vmix_assemble`. With no double-diffusion
contributor shipped yet, `Kd_extra_S ≡ 0` so the split reduces to `ks := kt`
⇒ bit-identical. `vmix_assemble` is the single downstream gate run once per
stage before vdiff. It applies, in order: background floors
(`kv_bg`/`kt_bg`/`ks_bg`, defaulting to `pp81_*_bg` so the floor is a no-op for
the shipped path), ceilings (`kv_max`/`kd_max`, default `huge` = off), optional
1-2-1 horizontal smoothing of kv/kt/ks (`kd_smooth_iterations`, default 0), and
an optional negative/NaN guard (`vmix_guard`, default off). All defaults are
bit-identical to the pre-assembly chain. `vdiff_apply_tracers` takes
`kt_source` (temperature) and `ks_source` (salinity + every passive tracer,
MOM6's `Kd_salt` convention) — `ks ≡ kt` until a double-diffusion contributor
lands (PR-33). Future Area-C contributors (tidal mixing, double-diffusion,
geothermal-adjacent floors, background profiles) plug in upstream of the
split. Tests: `test_ocean_vmix_assembly`, `test_ocean_vdiff`.

| Fox-Kemper ML-eddy restratification (B5) | `&ocean_foxkemper_nml enable` | `test_ocean_foxkemper`, `test_ocean_mle_zfixed` |
| Gent-McWilliams thickness diffusion ([2]) | `&ocean_gm_nml enable` (needs `&ocean_slopes_nml enable`) | `test_ocean_gm`, `test_ocean_gm_zfixed`, `test_ocean_slopes_datum` |

Notes: explicit biharmonic is CFL-capped (`ν₄·dt·((π/dx)²+(π/dy)²)² ≤ 2`); MOM6
production reaches higher ν₄ via implicit time-stepping we don't have. The ocean
velocity-Laplacian paths (scalar `nu_h` and the flow-aware per-face closures) take
an optional per-face harmonic clamp `&ocean_hvisc_nml bound_kh` (MOM6 `BOUND_KH`,
ceiling `bound_coef·0.125/(dt·(1/dx²+1/dy²))`, `test_ocean_hvisc_kh_bound`) —
load-bearing on the split-explicit ocean path, where an over-large `ν_h·dt/dx²`
anti-damps grid-scale barotropic gravity modes through the frozen `F_bt` forcing
(see `src/core/ocean/README.md`); the Lagrangian double-gyre configs run it with
`bound_coef = 0.15`. The ocean tensor form is free-slip. So are the
velocity-form Laplacian and biharmonic kernels: every corner (shear) flux of
both chained Laplacians is scaled by the C1 slip factor
`(1-2·ns)·wet_q + 2·ns` (MOM6 `sh_xy = mask2dBu·(...)`), so the zero stored at
a land face is never read as a Dirichlet-0 wall. Before 2026-09-30 it was, which
made every coast partially no-slip and let the biharmonic ring against each
staircase step. The harmonic kernels honour `no_slip`; the biharmonic kernel is
always free-slip, since MOM6 refuses NOSLIP with BIHARMONIC.
(`validation_examples/ocean/coastal_noise_box`). The ocean `lateral_closure` knob is **fail-loud** — a
tag with no dispatcher kernel (or a mistyped/garbage string) aborts at configure
(`validate_config` → `lateral_closure_is_implemented`) instead of silently
falling back to background-only viscosity. `leith_biharm` fills the per-face
`nu4_face_*` (same biharmonic apply as `smag_ah`); the harmonic Laplacian stays
on the scalar `nu_h` underneath it. The biharmonic add-on (`nu_4` / `smag_ah`
/ `leith_biharm`) composes with **all three** harmonic dispatch arms,
including the `stress_tensor` path — an early `return` used to silently
disable it whenever `stress_tensor=.true.`, which is now fixed; `kh_aniso`
(only consulted on the `stress_tensor` path) is likewise no longer mutually
exclusive with the biharmonic — both are independent linear operators that
superpose.

Fox-Kemper (B5, `rdb_ocean_mle`) is a lateral **restratification** closure, not
a viscosity: submesoscale mixed-layer eddies slump lateral buoyancy fronts via
an overturning streamfunction `Ψ = Ce·(H_ml²/|f|)·∇b̄·μ(z)`.  It injects
ML-confined per-layer mass transports (`uhml`/`vhml`) into the continuity mass
fluxes BEFORE the divergence — never touching velocities — so it is conservative
by construction (`Σ_k a(k)=0`, a closed overturning cell).  `H_ml` is taken from
`epbl%mld` (EPBL is the enabler; `enable` requires `ocean_epbl_nml enable`).  Runs
at THERMO cadence, once per outer step.  Two timescale forms (`use_mom_mixrate`):
the bare `Ce/max(|f|,f_floor)` FK08 floor form (analytic-gate default), and the
FK11 momentum-mixrate form (`use_mom_mixrate=.true.`, **production-recommended** —
it suppresses restratification under vigorous mixing).  `resolution_taper` is a
B2 hook (hard config error until B2 lands); slow-filtered-MLD second transport is
deferred (instantaneous MLD only).  Default off ⇒ bit-identical.
**Fox-Kemper on partial-step z-level faces** (`&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces`):
the cell-centre ML walk (`b̄`, `htot`) skips every non-live layer, so no ML
property is read from a bed or draft filler and the walk starts at the first
live layer from the top.  Each face builds its overturning on its OPEN column —
the layers open at that face (`open_u/open_v`) and live on both sides, GM's and
Redi's set: the FK σ coordinate walks the masked face thickness only (`hf = 0`
off the open set ⇒ `a(k) = 0` there), so σ = 0 at the top of the open column
(the ice base under a draft), and `H_vel` is clamped to the open-column
thickness `Σ_k hf` — without the clamp a mixed layer deeper than a face's open
column (a deep column abutting a shallow step) stops the σ walk above −1 and
`Σ_k a(k) ≠ 0` (prototype `python_prototypes/mle_zfixed`: −0.93).  The clamped
`H_vel` also sets the `H_vel²` amplitude and the timescale.  `uhml`/`vhml` are
written exactly zero off the open set; `Σ_k uhml = 0` at every face.  The open
face thickness is staged in `uhml`/`vhml` by a host-gated pre-pass, so the
transport kernels never name the knob-off `(1,1,1)` mask placeholders.  With
nothing closed the open path is the full-column form bitwise; knob off ⇒
byte-identical.  Test: `test_ocean_mle_zfixed`.  MLE needs EPBL's MLD, and EPBL
is refused under a cavity, so MLE under an ice draft is reached only by the
kernel test.

Gent-McWilliams ([2], `rdb_ocean_gm`) is the interior eddy-induced **bolus**
thickness diffusion (GM90/Griffies98): the skew-flux streamfunction
`Ψ = -KhTh·dy·S` on the stored isopycnal slope `S` (`&ocean_slopes_nml`, a loud
configure prerequisite; its interface-tilt rotation term `−∂zρ·(e_W − e_E)`
differences GEOPOTENTIAL interface heights built bed-up from `−D`, the slot's own
ghost-correct copy of `barotropic%b`, so a flat stratification over any
bathymetry reads zero slope on every coordinate — `test_ocean_slopes_datum`)
is turned into per-layer thickness transports
(`uhD`/`vhD`) by the MOM6 `uhtot` column recurrence with a safe-streamfunction
slope limiter + a mass-availability limiter (keeps `h ≥ H_VANISHED` without a
post-hoc clamp).  **Its own sequential operator on the CURRENT thickness**, as
MOM6's `thickness_diffuse` (MOM.F90:1388, after `step_MOM_dyn_split_RK2`;
in-place `h` update at MOM_thickness_diffuse.F90:639-641): every outer step,
after the stage loop (and the ssp_rk2 average), `run_gm_step` computes
`uhD`/`vhD` from the thickness the dynamics LEFT and `continuity_gm_apply` moves
`h` and every tracer by them with the same `dt` — through the resolved path's
own PPM tracer kernels (x half, seam refresh, y half), or, under windowed tracer
advection, into the `uhtr`/`vhtr` window accumulator (MOM6 `uhtr += uhD·dt`).
The per-face cap `A·(h−H_VANISHED)/(4·dt)` (MOM_thickness_diffuse.F90:896-906)
therefore bounds what is actually there: no layer goes below
`min(h, H_VANISHED)`.  Until 2026-10 the transports were computed at the top of
the step from the stage-ENTRY `h` and FOLDED into the resolved continuity
sweeps, so the cap bounded the wrong thickness and the resolved outflow came on
top — an 8.6 cm partial bed cell on the 1° Southern Ocean's open z\* steps was
drained to `−8.2e-4 m` (test `gm_sequential_partial_cell`; prototype
`python_prototypes/gm_sequential/`).  Conservative by construction
(`Σ_k uhD = 0`); zeroed on every non-periodic physical edge face (walls,
sponges, every OBC — MOM6 `OBCmaskCu/Cv`), so no GM flux leaves the domain.
Under `eulerian_z` the vertical advection cancels the bolus divergence per layer
exactly as it cancels the resolved one.  KhTh is a 2D face field
(constant-fill; CFL-clamped via `khth_max_cfl`; VarMix / MEKE make it
spatially varying).  `gm_src` carries the `-¼·Σ_k ρ₀·KH·S²·N²·h` PE release
MEKE reads at the top of the next step (restart-registered, as are the slopes
and the VarMix KhTh the operator reads between thermo refreshes).  The slope /
VarMix / MEKE refresh runs at THERMO cadence at the top of the step; the
operator itself runs every outer step (MOM6: every dynamics step — the fold
applied GM on thermo steps only, i.e. at `1/dt_therm_ratio` strength).
**Bottom-blocking** (MOM6 "avoid moving dense water upslope from below the
level of the bottom on the receiving side", MOM_thickness_diffuse.F90:1097-1114;
`gm_block_below_bed`): the unlimited streamfunction at an interface is zeroed
when its donor layer lies entirely below the RECEIVING column's bed (`−D`), and
scaled by the fraction of the donor layer above that bed when it straddles it.
Without it, GM poured deep water through every open z\* step into the fillers
below the shallow column's bed, which the remap handed to its bottom live layer:
on the 1° Southern Ocean (open steps, `hvel_mom6 + bbl_glue`, linear piston
drag) that was the whole GM-attributable energy excess — En at day 10
`1.24e-3` folded / `1.46e-3` sequential without blocking / `6.93e-4` with it,
against `7.10e-4` with GM off and `5.60e-4` with closed faces (unchanged by
either change: `5.61e-4`).  Deferred: FGNV/EBT/int_slope, refreshing the slopes
on the post-dynamics `h` (MOM6 recomputes them there).  Default off ⇒
bit-identical.
**Partial-step z-level faces** (`&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces`): GM builds
its overturning on each face's OPEN column — the layers open at that face
(`open_u/open_v`) and live on both sides.  A layer outside it gets zero
transport and zero availability, so the streamfunction is carried unchanged
across it and is 0 at the bottom of the open column; the non-divergence closure
lands in the TOPMOST open layer instead of `k = nz`, so it is 0 at the top as
well.  `uhD = 0` on every closed face-layer and filler, `Σ_k uhD = 0` at every
face.  The slopes slot keeps its general geopotential tilt term (z_fixed
interfaces sit at fixed depths below `z = 0`, so their tilt is `O(Δη)`) and,
on the same knob, zeroes slope / N² at every interface not strictly inside
the face's open column, so `gm_src` (and hence MEKE) sees only real water.
Non-finite slopes / N² are read as zero before the NaN-blind limiter clamps.
With nothing closed the recurrence is the full-column form operation for
operation; knob off ⇒ byte-identical.  Test: `test_ocean_gm_zfixed`.
**Redi on partial-step z-level faces** (`&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces`):
each face pairs only its OPEN WINDOW — the contiguous run of layers, counted
down from the topmost one, that are open at the face (`open_u/open_v`) and live
on both sides (the set GM's open column uses).  Phase A builds both columns'
interface T/S/P and runs the continuous neutral-surface sweep on the window
layers alone (`P` is the full column's surface-relative pressure sliced to the
window), so no neutral surface starts or ends in a filler or a closed
face-layer and the PPM reconstruction never reads one; Phase B rebuilds the
tracer columns on the same window (stored per face, `uKb/uKt`/`vKb/vKt`) and
scatters only inside it.  The flux on every closed face-layer and every filler
is exactly zero; content is conserved and the down-gradient sign guard is
unchanged.  A window layer no longer live when Phase B runs skips the face
(symmetric for both cells).  Without the window the full-column pairing put
fluxes with `hEff` up to the layer thickness through closed face-layers once
the isopycnals tilt by more than a bed step.  All-open window ⇒ the
full-column arithmetic bitwise; knob off ⇒ byte-identical.  On EVERY path
Phase A and Phase B read layer T/S by the I1′ column rule
(`rdb_vl_column_conc`: `hTr/h` on a live layer, the donor's on a vanished
one).  Before 2026-10-05 they used `hTr/max(h, 1e-20)`.  With closed faces
off the window is the whole column, so a thin partial cell drained negative
by continuity was read as T ~ 1e17 and Redi put 5e12 of content into it
(1-degree Southern Ocean, `zstar`, step 12; `open_steps_drained_cell_bounded`).
Live layers read the same divide as before.  Test:
`test_ocean_redi_zfixed`.  Redi under a cavity stays refused.
**MOM6 divergence (recorded, not deferred — PR-8):** MOM6's
thickness-diffusion (ALE mode) always runs its top layer through a
linear return-flow closure (`nk_linear = max(GV%nkml,1) = 1`, not a namelist
parameter).  Roundabout's `gm_column_x`/`_y` never did this — the field that would
have selected it (`nk_linear`) was permanently 0, and PR-8 found the branch it
gated was wired to the wrong end of the column (bed-most, not surface-most, per
Roundabout's bottom-up convention) — so it was deleted as dead rather than wired.
Wiring a correct surface region is a live physics change (moves every GM
answer) left to a future PR + analytical test; see the `!! DIVERGENCE
(MOM6 nk_linear):` docstring on `gm_column_x`.

MEKE ([5], `rdb_ocean_meke`) closes the GM↔eddy-energy loop: a 2D prognostic
eddy-kinetic-energy field `E(i,j)` (Jansen 2015 / Eden-Greatbatch 2008 / Marshall
2012) sourced by GM's `gm_src` PE release (`&ocean_gm_nml enable` is a loud
prerequisite — MEKE needs it), damped by an implicit backward-Euler bottom drag
(`drag_rate = ρ₀·i_mass·√(cdrag²·(2·γb²·E + u_bbl² + uscale²))`, the ρ₀ factor
being MOM6's `GV%H_to_RZ`; fixed in PR-5 — the drag rate was previously missing
this factor and was ~ρ₀ too weak, a dimensional bug not a knob),
and transported by a harmonic-mass Laplacian (+ optional biharmonic).  Strang
split per thermo step: explicit source bump → drag half → diffusion → drag half
(the two half-drags collapse to one full drag when neither `meke_kh≥0` nor
`meke_k4≥0`).  The derived diffusivity `kh = khcoeff·√(2·γt²·E)·Lmix` (harmonic
sum of deformation / frictional / Rhines / Eady / grid scales, each
alpha-gated) is added as the geometric mean `khth_fac·√(kh_i·kh_{i+1})` into the
VarMix face KhTh/KhTr accumulator BEFORE GM's CFL clamp (so GM consumes the
MEKE-augmented KhTh next; one-step gm_src lag).  `meke` is restart-persistent.
`khth_fac=khtr_fac=0` (default) ⇒ feedback inert; VarMix off ⇒ E still evolves
but the feedback has no face accumulator.  The Rhines scale is live
(`alpha_rhines>0`; `β=|∇f|` from the MEKE slot's own `f_centre`, filled at setup
from the Coriolis path and scaled by `idxT`/`idyT`), and upwind barotropic
advection is live (`advection_factor>0`; mass-weighted `baroHu` from
`mass_flux_*_layer`, conservative).  Remaining upstream gaps: per-face BBL
`drag_visc` (needs `Kv_bbl`/`bbl_thick` on the bottom-drag slot; drag carried by
`cdrag`) and the frictional `mom_src` source (needs a per-cell lateral-dissipation
output on the hvisc slot).  Default off ⇒ bit-identical.

MEKE harmonic backscatter (`&ocean_meke_nml backscatter`) closes the
eddy-energy→momentum loop in the other direction: `meke_step` fills
`Ku = backscatter_visc_coeff_ku·√(2·E)·Lmix` (MOM6 `MEKE_VISCOSITY_COEFF_KU`;
plain `√(2·E)` — no `γt²`, unlike kh; harmonic only in v1, vertical structure
`BS_struct=1`), and `meke_backscatter_apply`
subtracts a face-average of `Ku` from the resolved per-face harmonic viscosity
(`lateral_mix%ah_face_x/y`) so the NET coefficient can go negative — a
negative-viscosity energy return into the resolved flow.  The net is floored at
the forward-Euler viscous-CFL lower bound `−0.8·0.5/(dt·(idx²+idy²))` per face
(MOM6 `BACKSCATTER_UNDERBOUND`), which bounds the negative mode's growth rate but
does NOT stabilise it alone — a positive biharmonic backstop (`nu_4`/`smag_ah`/
`leith_biharm`) is mandatory, enforced fail-loud at configure.
Runs after `ocean_lateral_mix_compute` (reads the prior thermo step's `Ku`), needs
a flow-aware closure active for `ah_face_*` to be consumed.  Default off ⇒
bit-identical.  Deferred: biharmonic `Au`, EBT/SQG vertical structure.

## Bottom drag

| Form | ocean | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Quadratic log-layer (Cd) | `default` | MOM6/ROMS `Cd ≈ 2.5e-3` |
| Linear (Rayleigh) | `form="linear"` | Rayleigh drag rate `r` (1/s) |
| Bed layer = first LIVE layer | — | every bottom-drag form (bed-only, HBBL band, implicit-fold rate) and the vdiff bed row sit on the face's first live layer counting up from the bed, `ms%k_bot_u/v` (`max` of the two columns' `k_bot`, built once at configure from the `z_fixed` target at `η = 0`; `≡ 1` off `z_fixed` ⇒ bit-identical). Under `z_fixed` the bed fillers below it are identity rows and take no drag. Test: `test_ocean_zfixed_k_bot` |
| HBBL-distributed | `hbbl` | spreads stress over bottom `hbbl` m, walk starting at `k_bot_u/v`; REQUIRED under `zstar_full` — its bed-side layers vanish dynamically (`k_bot ≡ 1`), so the bed-only mode drags `k=1`, a filler in every column shallower than the deepest layer (configure warns) |
| Implicit-fold (backward-Euler vdiff bed diagonal) | `&ocean_vdiff_nml implicit_drag` | folds bottom drag into the vdiff bed-row (`k = k_bot_u/v`) diagonal as a stress bottom-BC instead of the explicit pre-solve add; thin-layer (z*/ZSTAR_FULL pinch-out) CFL-stable. Mutually exclusive with `&ocean_bdrag_nml implicit` (split-apply), fail-loud at configure; with HBBL (`hbbl>0`) only under `bbl_glue` (whose piston then replaces the fold). Test: `test_ocean_vdiff_implicit_stress_drag` |
| MOM6 `BOTTOMDRAGLAW` — drag in the vertical viscosity (BBL glue) | `&ocean_vdiff_nml bbl_glue` (+ `hvel_mom6`, required) | MOM6 `set_viscous_BBL` (`MOM_set_viscosity.F90:151`) per face, once per outer step (`vdiff_set_viscous_bbl`): `u* = √cd·u_bbl` (`u_bbl` the HBBL-mean `√(u²+v_at_u²+bg_vel²)`; linear form `√cd·bg_vel` with `cd = r·hbbl/bg_vel`), the KW99 stratification (`400ρ₀u*²/g`, EOS derivatives at the BBL T/S and bottom pressure) and rotation limited `bbl_thick` (floored at `bbl_thick_min`, capped at `hbbl/2` under kappa-shear = MOM6 RiNo_mix), `kv_bbl = √cd·u*·bbl_thick`. The momentum solve (`find_coupling_coef`, `MOM_vert_friction.F90:2214-2259`) adds `(kv_bbl − KV)·botfn` to the near-bed interface viscosity, caps `h_shear` toward `bbl_thick`, and takes the bed row as the piston `kv_bbl/min(hvel/2, bbl_thick)` — which REPLACES the explicit / `&ocean_bdrag_nml implicit` / `implicit_drag` bed drag on the layers (the explicit tendency still feeds the barotropic `F_slow`). Law and parameters from `&ocean_bdrag_nml` (`hbbl = 0` ⇒ `&ocean_vdiff_nml hbbl_visc`); no drag configured ⇒ inert. Not ported: OBC zero-gradient projection, tidal `u2_bg`, channel drag, body-force drag, `CORRECT_BBL_BOUNDS`. Tests: `test_ocean_vdiff_bbl` (`set_viscous_bbl_*`, `glue_quadratic_single_layer_piston`) |

## Ice-shelf top drag (`&ocean_tdrag_nml`; ocean only, default off)

Kernel + slot: `src/parameterizations/vertical/rdb_ocean_top_drag.F90`
(`ocean_top_drag_t`), computed and applied beside the bottom drag in
`run_stage` / `run_stage_split` and added into the barotropic slow forcing by
`add_top_drag_into_F_slow`.  The mirror of the bottom drag about the middle of
the column: the sink lives at `k = nz`, masked by ice cover on FACES.  Requires
`&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml enable` (fail-loud) — without a draft every face mask is
zero.  Default off ⇒ bit-identical.

**The face cover rule is OR:** `cover_u(i,j) = max(cover_frac(i−1,j),
cover_frac(i,j))`, so the CALVING-FRONT face feels the drag.  AND would leave a
free-slip band exactly where the cavity outflow leaves.  **One `C_d`:** with
`&ocean_cavity_melt_nml` on, the melt `u*` takes its coefficient from
`&ocean_tdrag_nml cd` and a disagreeing `cdrag_top` is refused at configure —
MOM6 carries two independent coefficients, this model deliberately does not.

| Form | ocean | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Quadratic log-layer (Cd) | `default` when enabled | ISOMIP+ `C_d = 2.5e-3` (Asay-Davis et al. 2016, Table 4, which prescribes the same quadratic law top and bottom); `du/dt = −C_d·\|U\|·u/h_nz`.  Test: `test_ocean_top_drag` |
| Linear (Rayleigh) | `form="linear"` | rate `r` (1/s); the form with a closed-form spin-down.  Test: `test_ocean_top_drag` |
| HTBL-distributed | `htbl` | spreads the stress over the top `htbl` m — the `hbbl` mode reflected; keeps the explicit rate finite where sigma thins the top layer near a grounding line (Killworth & Edwards 1999).  Distributed linear rate `r·htbl/h_nz` asserted in closed form |
| Implicit (backward-Euler in the drag kernel) | `implicit` | tendency formed as `−λ·u/(1 + dt·λ)` so the ordinary apply gives `u/(1 + dt·λ)`; unconditionally stable for any top-layer thickness.  Test asserts it stays monotone and same-signed at `dt·λ = 2.5`, where the explicit form amplifies and flips sign |
| Implicit (fold into the vdiff `k=nz` diagonal) | `&ocean_vdiff_nml implicit_top_drag` | the OTHER implicit form, and a different thing: `dt·λ_top` on the surface diagonal of the backward-Euler vertical-friction tridiagonal, so the drag is solved TOGETHER with the interior shear rather than ahead of it.  The wind stress already owns that row's RHS — a drag is a diagonal term and a stress is an RHS term, so they compose — and on a covered face the wind RHS is scaled by `(1 − cover)`: no atmosphere under a shelf.  The explicit apply is gated off.  Layer-`nz` only (`htbl > 0` refused, the mirror of the `implicit_drag`/HBBL restriction) and mutually exclusive with `implicit` above (double count).  Test: `test_ocean_top_drag` (`u/(1 + dt·λ)` at `dt·λ = 8` on a 5 cm pinched top layer; open face takes the full wind, covered face takes none) |
| Top-drag stress magnitude | (always, when enabled) | `stress_top(nx,ny)` = cell-centred `\|τ_top\|` (N/m²), device-resident.  Copied INLINE by `run_stage` / `run_stage_split` into `surface_stress%stress_shelf` in the same stage that computes it, and read there by KPP and EPBL as `u_*² = (stress_mag + stress_shelf)/ρ₀` — the total upper-boundary momentum flux, with disjoint supports (`stress_mag ≡ 0` under cover, `stress_top ≡ 0` off it).  No lag.  Tests: `test_ocean_bl_under_ice` |
| Under-ice `u_*` for the boundary-layer schemes | `&ocean_tdrag_nml enable`, else `&ocean_cavity_melt_nml enable` | KPP (`rdb_ocean_vmix`, two sites) and EPBL (`rdb_ocean_epbl`) take `u_* = √((stress_mag + stress_shelf)/ρ₀)`.  `stress_shelf` is ALWAYS allocated and zero without a cavity ⇒ one code path, no optional dummy, `x + 0.0 ≡ x` ⇒ bit-identical.  Preferred source is the top drag (in-stage); with the top drag OFF and melt ON, `engine_step_finalize` fills it from `ρ₀·u_*²` with the melt slot's own `u_*` — the SAME `C_d` under the one-coefficient rule, but at thermo cadence, so **that** path lags one outer step.  Tests: `test_ocean_bl_under_ice` |

## Porous barriers (subgrid topography; ocean only)

Represent a subgrid sill/strait by reducing the **open** fraction of a C-grid
face below its full width, per layer, so a deep sill blocks the bottom layers
while the surface layers stay fully open.

| Scheme | ocean | Numerics | Primary test |
|---|---|---|---|
| Porous barriers (Adcroft 2013 three-parameter fit) | `&ocean_porous_nml enable` | per-face `d_min`/`d_max`/`d_avg` along-face topographic heights ⇒ monotone open-width profile `w(η)`; the layer-averaged OPEN-AREA fraction is the exact difference of the profile's vertical integral over the layer, `min(1, (A(η_hi)−A(η_lo))/(η_hi−η_lo))`. A DEGENERATE face (`d_max ≤ d_min`) and a VANISHED layer (`dz ≤ H_VANISHED`) are special-cased — see the caveat below. Recomputed on the device ONCE PER OUTER STEP and held across both RK2 stages (MOM6's cadence), then MULTIPLIED into the per-layer transports of continuity-PPM (both the fused and the direction-split forms, both directions, before the barotropic renormalisation, which carries the open fraction in BOTH its `sum_h` denominator and its per-layer increment) and of the Coriolis/advection **transport** forms (`sadourny_energy`, `sadourny_hk`). The default velocity-form `sadourny` has no `u·h·dy_cu` transport to narrow, so porosity reaches it only through continuity. The BAROTROPIC substep transports on `dy_cu_bt`/`dx_cv_bt` — the same widths scaled by the COLUMN-INTEGRATED open fraction, which is identically the thickness-weighted mean of the per-layer fractions (an exact telescoping identity, both being the same integral of `w` over the column). Without that the barotropic solve would be porous-blind and the per-layer renormalisation to `uhbt` would hand the blocked transport straight back, leaving the barrier a vertical redistribution that never reduces net flow. **This is NOT `BT_cont` parity**: MOM6's production barotropic face area is `Σ_k (dy_Cu·por_k)·h_marginal_k·visc_rem_k` (PPM marginal thickness AND `visc_rem`, neither of which appears here); its `Σ_k h_k·(dy_Cu·por_k)` form is the open-boundary-segment branch only, and `set_local_BT_cont_types` carries no `por` at all. NOT applied to: `areaCu`/`areaCv` (so BT Coriolis + KE use un-narrowed areas against narrowed transports, as in MOM6), GM/Redi/MEKE/hdiff, or sea ice. **Fail-loud exclusions** (`validate_config`): `&ocean_bt_nml bt_halo > 0` (the wide-halo BT clone re-fills its own `metrics_w` from the grid formula and nothing gives it the porous statistics, so the wide fast loop would silently transport on UN-narrowed widths) and `&ocean_wetdry_nml enable` (the vanishing-column interaction with the wet/dry outflow limiter is unvalidated). Multi-rank bit-identical (`test_ocean_decomp_bitid_mpi`). Default off ⇒ no kernel launch at all ⇒ byte-identical | `test_ocean_porous` |

## Partial-step z-level face closure (`vcoord_type = "z_fixed"`, `"zstar"` or `"zstar_full"`; ocean only)

The other per-layer face gate, and **independent** of the porous one: porous
barriers narrow a face continuously for topography the grid cannot resolve;
this closes a face completely for a layer the coordinate has already declared
dead.  Effective width is the product, `dy_eff(I,j,k) = dy_cu(I,j) ·
por_face_area_u(I,j,k) · open_u(I,j,k)`.

| Scheme | ocean | Numerics | Primary test |
|---|---|---|---|
| Partial-step z-level face closure (Adcroft, Hill & Marshall 1997; Losch 2008 §2.1) | `&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces` | Under `z_fixed` a layer whose nominal geopotential range lies inside the bed or the ice draft is an inert FILLER of thickness `zstar_h_min` (`≤ H_VANISHED`).  A velocity face at which that layer is a filler on EITHER side is a **WALL** for that layer, not a thin passage: no normal velocity, no mass or tracer flux, FREE-SLIP.  Left open, the FV pressure gradient integrates across a staircase step of height up to `h_nominal` and drives `\|ρ′\|·g·Δz_step/(ρ₀·dx)` out of a resting stratified state — thickness-independent, so no `h`-gate reaches it.  The mask `metrics%open_u/open_v` (`(nx+1,ny,nz)`/`(nx,ny+1,nz)`, 0/1) is built ONCE at configure by the `pure` builder `ocean_vcoord_closed_face_masks` from the coordinate's target at `η = 0` (`ocean_vcoord_eta0_target`: `ocean_vcoord_z_fixed_target`, `ocean_vcoord_zstar_target`, or the `ZSTAR_FULL` branch of `ocean_vcoord_geometric_target`) — the same kernel the ALE regrid and the IC seed use, so "live" has ONE definition — and is STATIC (bed and draft are static; `η` is absorbed by the first LIVE layer — to first order in `η/h_partial`: a bed partial cell thinner than `\|η\|` flips, on `z_fixed` and `zstar_full`).  **`zstar` (MOM6 z\*)** lays `z_fixed`'s nominal profile DILATED per column by `s = (H+η−n_f·h_min)/(H−n_f·h_min)` (MOM6 `build_zstar_column`'s `(H+η)/H` with the filler stack kept out of the dilation) and decides every layer's liveness at `η = 0` with `z_fixed`'s bed rule, so its `η = 0` target IS `z_fixed`'s bit for bit and its pattern is EXACTLY static for `η` of either sign (0 flips at `η = ±0.1 … ±2 m` on the 1° Southern Ocean, where MOM6's own column also flips none; `python_prototypes/mom6_zstar`) — the mask is `z_fixed`'s, every consumer reused, and the knob (or `&ocean_zinit_nml`) also seeds `h_layer` on the `η = 0` target with I1′ established on the seeded fillers.  **`zstar_full`** builds a z-level FINE zone (`zstar_h_surf_target`-thick layers from the surface, `nz/3` of them — `zstar_n_surf`/`zstar_stretching` are dead on the ocean path) over a terrain-following COARSE zone; a column shallower than the fine zone ends in a partial cell with every layer below it a filler, which is the same staircase and the same defect, so the knob (name historical) is accepted there too.  Its target puts `η ≥ 0` in the surface layer (pattern EXACTLY static) and clips `η < 0` from the bed; on the 1° Southern Ocean a uniform `η = −1 m` flips 131 columns against `z_fixed`'s 192 (and `z_fixed` also flips 144 at `+1 m`).  Under `zstar_full` the knob also SEEDS `h_layer` on that target (otherwise step 1 runs the sigma `b/nz` stack's PGF and a `target_source = "ic"` sponge snapshots the wrong layers) and establishes I1′ on the seeded fillers before the sponge snapshot.  It closes FILLER faces only: the coarse zone's OPEN faces keep the sigma PGF error.  Array-edge faces stay open, as in the porous kernel; a periodic seam is an INTERIOR index and is covered because the target is built from ghost-filled `bt_H_ref`/`z_top`; the built mask is then face-halo-exchanged (`ocean_halo_face_x/y`, plain copy), so the outermost ghost face — which the builder cannot evaluate and leaves open — carries its owner's value on a tile seam or a periodic wrap: the biharmonic's chained stencil reads the mask three ghosts deep, and without it a 1x4 decomposition was not bit-identical to one rank.  Consumers: the four continuity-PPM flux sites; the barotropic renormaliser's weight `wk = dy_cu·por·open` (so `uhbt` is distributed over the OPEN layers only and `Σ_k mass_flux = uhbt` stays exact); the transport-Coriolis mass fluxes (and, for `sadourny_hk`, the pair-floored PV of the Coriolis section — the HK cross pairs are otherwise unbounded next to a thin live partial cell); `mask_layer_velocities` after every stage; `&ocean_hdiff_nml kappa_h`; the HARMONIC velocity-Laplacian viscosity (each neighbour difference gated by the NEIGHBOUR's open flag, the tendency by the face's own — otherwise a zeroed closed-face velocity acts as Dirichlet-0, i.e. NO-slip drag); the velocity BIHARMONIC, both the scalar `nu_4` and the flow-aware `nu4_face_*` (`smag_ah`, `leith_biharm`) — the same gate on every difference of BOTH chained Laplacians (`hvisc_biharm_lap_closed`: the intermediate `lap_u/lap_v` IS the harmonic closed-face Laplacian and a closed face holds `lap = 0` that is never read as a value), the tendency by the face's own flag, so a closed face-layer is a free-slip (Neumann/mirror) boundary exactly as a `wet_q` land corner is, and with a constant `nu_4` the operator `-nu_4 A⁻¹L A⁻¹L` stays negative semi-definite (`L` symmetric); the momentum vertical-friction tridiagonal (face column `min(h_L,h_R)`, coupling CUT across any interface touching a closed layer — the decoupling the tracer matrix already had); and the ALE face-velocity remap (same `min` face column, closed layers dropped from source AND target); GM thickness diffusion (open-column streamfunction + slopes masked to the open column); Fox-Kemper MLE (open-column overturning, `H_vel` clamped to the open column, filler-skipping ML walk).  Tracer advection rides the already-masked `mass_flux_*_layer` and needs nothing, and `mask_layer_velocities` is re-asserted after the ALE remap (the remap is the last velocity writer of the step).  **Barotropic consistency** is part of the closure, not an extra: `derive_bt_from_layers`, `face_depth_mean_u/v` (+ the `visc_rem` twins), `set_cor_ref_velocity` (the `pred_corr` fast-loop Coriolis reference, MOM6 `ubt_Cor`) and `apply_bt_correction` all weight by `h_face·open`, so `ubt` is the OPEN-column depth mean and a CLOSED layer receives no barotropic increment BY CONSTRUCTION (not by a mask cleaning up after a uniform fold).  So do the three barotropic-substep paths that used to be refused: `&ocean_bt_nml upstream_h_face` (`compute_h_face_upstream` sums the OPEN upstream column `s = Σ_k h_up·por·open` and stores `s·dy_cu/dy_cu_bt`, so the fast-loop product `h_face_up·dy_cu_bt` is exactly the open-column transport the renormaliser hands to the layers — the full-column sum made it `H_up·φ_c`, wrong by `2·H_up/(H_D+H_S)` at a staircase face, which took the 1-degree Southern Ocean to the `maxvel` clamp and NaN at step 309), `substep_drag` (`compute_bt_rem`) and `wave_drag` (`compute_bt_rem_wave_drag`), which damp on the open-column face depth `Σ_k h_face·open`.  `metrics` is a REQUIRED argument of all four (and of those three), not an optional one: it WAS optional, `set_cor_ref_velocity` omitted it, and the full-column mean it silently took returned `φ·ū_open` instead of `ū_open` — leaving `Δa_u = +f·(1−φ_v)·v̄` forcing EVERY barotropic substep proportionally to the barotropic velocity itself; the OPEN layers get the uniform increment — the only form (PR-3 D1 revised: the visc_rem-weighted alternative, `correction_visc_rem`, is retired for the same reason as the h-weighted form below: both concentrate the whole increment into a subset of layers and both were measured to NaN/blow up a case this fold is load-bearing on) — see *Barotropic-correction fold weight*.  `dy_cu_bt`/`dx_cv_bt` carry `dy_cu·(Σ_k h_face·por·open)/(Σ_k h_face)`, recomputed from the LIVE `h` every outer step at the porous cadence and SUPERSEDING the porous write (the combined fraction already contains it).  `bt_H_ref` is untouched — a closed face removes transport capacity, not water.  **Fail-loud exclusions**: any coordinate but `z_fixed` / `zstar` / `zstar_full`; unresolved `z_fixed_h_ref` (`z_fixed`, `zstar`); `zstar_h_surf_target <= 0` (`zstar_full`: uniform sigma, no fillers); empty `bt_H_ref`; `&ocean_wetdry_nml enable`; `&ocean_bt_nml bt_halo > 0` (GM composes: its streamfunction is built on each face's OPEN column — see the GM paragraph; Redi composes: each face pairs only its contiguous OPEN WINDOW — see the Redi paragraph; Fox-Kemper MLE composes: its overturning is built on each face's OPEN column — see the Fox-Kemper paragraph); `&ocean_hvisc_nml stress_tensor` (and so `kh_aniso`, which only that path reads: its T-cell tension and corner shear are masked by the 2-D `wet_*` fields only); and the one barotropic path still on FULL-column weights — `&ocean_bt_nml correction_bc_pgf` (`compute_pbce`/`compute_gtot_faces`/the bc-PGF `du_bc` block: depth-mean-zero on the full column, not the open one); and `split_scheme = "pred_corr"` with `&ocean_bc_nml mask_wall_velocity = .false.` (an unmasked solid-wall face keeps a baroclinic layer velocity that the `u_av`-evaluated `pred_corr` Coriolis never rotates — the renormaliser that writes `u_av` skips wall faces — so it integrates its interior neighbour's layer Coriolis without bound: ×1783 in `KE+PE` over 4000 steps on the rotating ledge basin, all of it on the wall faces, vs ×0.74 with the default masked walls).  Single-rank.  Default off ⇒ the masks stay at their `(1,1,1)` placeholder, no branch is taken ⇒ byte-identical — but OFF is only legal over a STEP-FREE bed: `z_fixed` with the knob off is REFUSED at configure wherever a wet face joins two columns whose bed lies in different nominal layers (an open live/filler face; the open-staircase PGF blows the 1° Southern Ocean up in 3 steps), with the stepped-face count summed over ranks and the fix `zfixed_closed_faces = .true.` in the message; flat / step-free beds and a flat bed under a sloping draft (bed side only) stay accepted and untouched | `test_ocean_zfixed_closed_faces`, `test_ocean_zfixed_bt_seiche`, `test_ocean_zfixed_cor_ref`, `test_ocean_zstar_full_closed_faces`, `test_ocean_zstar_closed_faces`, `test_ocean_bt_upstream_zfixed`, `test_ocean_hvisc_biharm_zfixed`, `test_ocean_gm_zfixed`, `test_ocean_mle_zfixed`, `test_ocean_coriolis_hk_vanished` |

**What it does and does not buy.**  It removes the catastrophic, GEOMETRIC part
of the `z_fixed` resting-state defect: `cavity_sloping_lid_rest_zfixed.nml`
goes from NaN during day 18 to completing 30 days at `En = 2.332E-06 m²/s²`
with budgets at `6E-13`; the ISOMIP+ ice-free control SATURATES at
`1.005E-08` by day 2, 56 000× below its knob-off twin; and the ISOMIP+ cavity
leg goes from NaN during day 3 to `8.842E-09` at day 2 (max|u| ≈ 3.7 mm/s
against the throwaway spike's 0.26 m/s) and runs on to day 4.  It does **not** give a resting state — the classical
partial-step PGF error at an OPEN face between a PARTIAL and a FULL cell
survives, and that is Yung et al. (2026) §3.2, a separate slice.  The bit-zero
`cavity_flat_lid_rest_zfixed` gate is preserved exactly with the knob on.

**On `zstar_full`** (1° Southern Ocean, the `vcoord_audit` base with the knob
added, GPU): knob off dies at step 10 (first non-finite in `post_bt`, a 61 m
layer beside a `1e-4` filler); knob on completes 10 days, `En = 2.773E-02` at
day 10 and still rising ~`3E-03`/day, salt/heat budgets at `1E-13`.  That is
50× the `z_fixed` + closed-faces base (`5.493E-04`): the filler faces are
closed, but the terrain-following coarse zone's open faces carry the sigma PGF
error over `rx0 ≤ 0.99` bathymetry.  The mass budget reads `-8.2E-08` from
step 1 with the knob on AND off — a pre-existing `zstar_full` land-column
regrid (degenerate columns are re-laid at `nz·zstar_h_min`, not their seeded
`nz·H_VANISHED`), not this closure.

**Subgrid-data caveat.** The fit needs min/max/mean of a bathymetry finer than
the model grid; MOM6 reads that from an offline `topog_edge.nc`. Roundabout has no
such file plumbing yet, so `source="resolved"` (the only implemented source)
samples the **resolved** bathymetry at three along-face points (the two face
corners and the midpoint) — a documented PROXY that captures along-face slope
but is blind to genuine subgrid structure. `source="file"` fails loud pending
the same file-forcing backend `&ocean_bt_nml wave_drag_form="file"` waits on.

Three properties of the proxy are load-bearing and easy to get wrong:

* **Uniform ALONG the face ⇒ inert, not a wall.** All three samples are
  cell-centre averages, so a ridge or shelf break running *parallel* to the
  face collapses them onto one value. The bare fit's limit there is a STEP at
  the two-cell mean height — a hard wall on every layer below it, on a face the
  grid resolves as open. The kernel therefore treats a degenerate statistic
  (`d_max ≤ d_min`) as FULLY OPEN and blocks nothing. Flat bathymetry is the
  same degenerate case, which is what makes the resolved source a literal no-op
  on a flat basin. Faces that *cross* the structure still narrow normally.
* **Land cells are gated out.** A corner sample averages four cells; a land
  elevation in that stencil would pull `d_max` up and block a wet–wet face the
  grid fully resolves (measured: ~37% spurious blockage from one 4000 m land
  diagonal beside a 4000 m column). A corner whose stencil is not entirely wet
  falls back to the two-cell face midpoint.
* **`eta_interp="max"` blocks the LEAST, not the most.** `w` is monotone
  increasing in the interface height, so the rule returning the *higher*
  (shallower) of the two adjacent interfaces leaves the most of the face open.
  `"min"` is the most blocking. Combined with the point above, `"max"` on
  smooth resolved bathymetry is close to inert.

A layer whose face thickness is at or below `H_VANISHED` (1.5e-4 m) gets
`por = 0`; MOM6 uses `Angstrom_Z` (1e-10 m), 1.5 million times smaller, so
layers between the two thresholds get a real fraction there and zero here, and
the column-integrated fraction is the thickness-weighted mean over the
NON-vanished layers only. A wholly vanished column blocks every layer AND
zeroes the barotropic width, so the two modes agree.

Multi-rank: bit-identical to one rank (the periodic seamount channel of
`tests/mpi/test_ocean_decomp_bitid_mpi`, every 2- and 4-rank factorisation).
The open-area fields have no halo exchange of their own (MOM6 `pass_vector`s
them); every rank recomputes them over its whole array, seam columns
included, from the exchanged bathymetry and thickness.

## Ice-shelf cavity geometry + load (static draft, barotropic datum, top-of-column pressure; ocean only)

A prescribed, time-constant ice draft `z_draft(i,j)` (m, positive **down**)
laid over the bed and absorbed into the **barotropic datum**, so a cavity
column starts from its loaded equilibrium rather than from `z = 0`; its
isostatic load is carried into the **pressure** through
`multilayer_state_t%p_top` and into the **barotropic mode** through the
datum — each exactly once, and never onto the `eta_forcing` seam.

| Piece | Form | Knob | Numerics / envelope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Static ice draft `z_draft` | `"none"` (identity) / `"flat"` (uniform inside the shelf box, 0 beyond the calving front `draft_x1`) / `"linear"` (`d0 + s·(x−x0)`, clipped at 0) / `"file"` (**fails loud** — the MPI-correct static-2-D reader is a later slice, and it is the only route to an ISOMIP+ draft, which has no analytic form) | `&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml enable` + `draft_config` | Filled on the host immediately after the bathymetry, FULL array including ghosts (formula evaluated at the ghost position), then carried through the bathymetry's own periodic/fold re-wrap + halo sequence. Box corners are METRES converted to GRID units (degrees on spherical/curvilinear) at the dispatch, like `&ocean_topo_nml slope_scale`; `±1e30` is the "no limit on this side" sentinel, which is what a shelf that reaches a wall needs. `draft_source="thickness"` converts an ice thickness by flotation, `ρ_ice·h/ρ₀`; `"in_situ"` isostasy fails loud. Tests: `test_ocean_cavity_draft` |
| **Datum** `bt_H_ref = b − z_draft` | the whole dynamical effect of a STATIC load | (implied by `enable`) | `bt_eta = Σh_layer − bt_H_ref` is then the deviation from the **loaded** equilibrium — zero at rest under the shelf — which is Losch (2008) §2.1's own convention. Every consumer of the water-column thickness `D = bt_H_ref + bt_eta` (BT continuity face thickness, Chapman phase speed, ALE `remap_h_ref`, the BT↔layer rescale) is then correct with NO cavity branch of its own. The geopotential stack is a separate datum and stays absolute (`e_face(1) = −b` from the true bed, so the column top lands at `−z_draft + η` by itself). Counted-once invariant: `ρ_ref·g·z_draft + (bt_H_ref − b)·ρ_ref·g ≡ 0`, asserted at configure. Gate: `test_ocean_cavity_equivalence` — a flat lid over a deep bed evolves like a shallower ocean |
| **Grounding** → LAND | `b − z_draft < h_min_cavity` ⇒ `wet_mask = 0` | `h_min_cavity` (default 10 m), `grounded_max_frac` | Routed through the SAME `seed_wet_mask_impl` the bathymetry uses, so the static metric-zeroing land mask and the finite land-state hold follow for free. **Never a thin film of water under grounded ice.** More than `grounded_max_frac` of the interior columns grounded ⇒ fail loud. No ice over land: the draft is forced to 0 wherever `b < LAND_DEPTH_THRESHOLD` (count logged), which keeps the counted-once invariant exact on every column |
| Isostatic load `p_ice_ref = (ρ_ref·GRAVITY)·z_draft` | Boussinesq-isostatic (flotation) load, ISOMIP+ §3.1.1's own `p = −ρ_sw·g·z_d` form | (implied by `enable`) | Formed as the SAME single product the FV-MOM6 surface BC forms, so `pa(nz+1) = ρ_ref·g·(−z_draft) + p_ice_ref` cancels to bit-zero at rest (to the rounding of one product under FMA contraction). Not the TRUE overburden of a stratified column (`g∫ρ̂`), which differs by `−g∫(ρ̂−ρ₀)` and leaves a depth-uniform `N²·z_draft·∇z_draft` residual in the raw PGF — chosen because ISOMIP+ prescribes it and it cancels bit-exactly against the datum in a uniform-density column; under the default split (`&ocean_bt_nml bc_pgf_forcing`) the depth-uniform residual is a real bottom-pressure gradient the barotropic mode adjusts to (`cavity_sloping_lid_load_shortfall_drives_bt`), where the legacy split annihilated it. `trim_ic_for_p_surf` (MOM6 `TRIM_IC_FOR_P_SURF`, default off; linear EOS + zinit `source="linear"`, else fails loud) balances it at t = 0 by moving each loaded column's initial top to where the water above it weighs the load (`cavity_trim_eta_linear_impl`; `trim_ic_root_is_the_displaced_weight`, `trim_ic_balances_the_depth_mean_pfu`). `draft_source="in_situ"` (the true solve) fails loud |
| **Load partition** `ms%p_top = p_ice_ref + sf%p_surf` | static ice load + atmospheric/anomaly load | consumers: `&ocean_pgf_nml p_top_in_bc`, `&ocean_psurf_nml in_eos` | Assembled on the host in `configure_ocean_cavity` (FINAL for a cavity without the psurf seam — the draft is static), and re-assembled once per outer step as an INLINE `do concurrent` in `ocean_dyn_step_split` when the psurf seam makes `sf%p_surf` live. Whole array, ghosts included ⇒ no halo of its own. `p_ice_ref` is **never** added to `sf%p_surf`: `eta_ib = −p_surf/(ρ₀·g_bt)` is built from that total and the datum already carries the same load, so only the ANOMALY reaches the `eta_forcing` seam — which for the isostatic default IS `sf%p_surf`. ⇒ an inverse-barometer run with no cavity is bit-identical, and a cavity with `p_surf = 0` sends the seam nothing (bit-identical to having no seam at all). Gates: `test_ocean_cavity_load`, `test_ocean_cavity_equivalence` |
| **`p_top_in_bc` REQUIRED for a varying draft** | fail-loud refusal, not auto-enable | `&ocean_pgf_nml p_top_in_bc` | A draft that VARIES must have its load in the `pa(nz+1)` BC: otherwise the stack sits ~5e6 Pa off its anomaly scale, the unsplit driver feels a raw `g·∇z_draft ≈ 2e-2 m/s²`, and any non-uniform barotropic-correction weight redistributes the uncancelled uniform force as a real per-layer shear. Refused at configure (on the FILLED array) and in `validate_config` (on the namelist shape). A UNIFORM draft is EXEMPT — a load with no gradient is bit-identically inert in the top BC — which is what keeps the flat-lid equivalence gate expressible loaded and unloaded |
| **Rest residual under a sloping draft** | `PFu(k) − ⟨PFu⟩_h = N²·D³·(3σ_k²−1)/(12·dx·H̄)`, `D = s·dx` | — | The sigma-coordinate PGF truncation: second order in `dx`, CUBIC in the draft slope, independent of `nz`. Measured end to end (flat bed, flat isopycnals, `f = 0`, no forcing, 12000 s, `s = 1e-3`, `N² = 1e-5`): **`max\|u\| = 7.08e-8 m/s`** against the derived `a_peak·t = 1.04e-7`; with `N² = 0` it vanishes and the run sits at `2.6e-13 m/s`. This is the baseline for the sloping-coordinate PGF corrections (a later phase). Gates: `test_ocean_cavity_load` (unit) and `validation_examples/ocean/ice_shelf_cavity/` (end to end, 48x6x15 @ 2 km, 30 days, ZERO viscosity/drag/mixing): flat lid **`0.000E+00`**, uniform density **`1.34E-20`**, stratified sloping lid **`3.04E-08`** at day 30 after a 20-day plateau at the derived `1.0-2.1E-09`, then a ~3.2-day e-folding SATURATING at `3.89E-06` by day 60. dt-independent, only delayed by viscosity, absent without the lid slope or without stratification. Scoped XFAIL on `energy:rest-settles`; gates at `REST_1MM_S`, NOT the design's `REST_100UM_S` -- that is Phase 6's acceptance criterion (Yung et al. 2026, JAMES 18, e2025MS005645) |

**Envelope (every row fails loud at configure, naming the knob and the
reason):** `&ocean_pgf_nml form="fv_mom6"` and `gfs_scale = 1`; `vcoord_type`
in {`sigma`, `z_fixed`} — the family that rescales the live column and so
follows the ice base for free, plus the one taught the ice base (see the
`z_fixed` row below); the refusal message carries the OFFENDING
family's own reason, and they are not all "anchors at `z = 0`": `lagrangian`,
`zstar_sigma`, `rho` and `hycom` are geometrically datum-safe and are refused
for want of VALIDATION, while `zstar` (MOM6 z\*, since 2026-10; it was the
sigma branch under another name before and was accepted as such) has no
rigid-top branch, `zstar_full` inverts which half of the column is resolved, `eulerian_z` drops
the free surface and `zsigma` is refused everywhere (see the vertical-coordinate
table below) — and `thickness_config /= "uniform_z"`; the SPLIT
solver (`n_inner ≥ 1`); single rank; `bt_halo = 0` (also in
`bt_halo_auto_exclusion`, so AUTO resolves to 0 instead of manufacturing a
width); and mutually exclusive with wet/dry, porous barriers, sea ice and
`&ocean_tides_nml use_sal`. `&ocean_zinit_nml enable` COMPOSES (its refusal
was lifted with P5.3 — the overlay measures depth from `z = 0`, not from the
column top). Default off ⇒ byte-identical.

## Wind-stress application (multilayer)

| Mode | ocean | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Surface-concentrated (top layer) | `default` (DIRECT_STRESS) | generates Ekman/ML shear; required for solver Kato-Phillips √t |
| Implicit-fold (backward-Euler vdiff surface row) | `&ocean_vdiff_nml implicit_stress` | folds wind stress into the vdiff surface (`k=nz`) RHS row as a Neumann top-BC instead of the explicit pre-solve add; thin-layer CFL-stable. Incompatible with `&ocean_vmix_nml direct_stress` (distributed stress), fail-loud at configure. Test: `test_ocean_vdiff_implicit_stress_drag` |

## Baroclinic pressure gradient / PGF

| Variant | ocean | Knob |
|---|---|---|
| Montgomery / FV-lite / FV-Wright / gprime / FV-MOM6 | `form=` | `&ocean_pgf_nml`; **default `"mont"`** |
| Montgomery potential (Boussinesq `M = p/ρ0 + (g·ρ/ρ0)·z`, vertical recursion seeded at the free surface + ONE horizontal difference, plus the `z_eff`-weighted horizontal-density term) | `form="mont"` (**default**) | `&ocean_pgf_nml`; general-purpose — valid over sloping bathymetry and every vcoord, EXACT at rest in isopycnal (`VCOORD_LAGRANGIAN`) columns wherever a layer is present on both sides of a face, and algebraically identical to `fv_lite` on aligned columns. Never forms a pressure stack, so it avoids `fv_lite`'s ~1e4 cancellation when differencing a ~2e7 Pa column. Where layer thicknesses are UNEQUAL across a face (σ/z*σ over a slope) `mont` and `fv_lite` are DIFFERENT discretisations of the same term — neither is exact there; measured on the 34 shipped namelists that do not pin `form` the end-of-run energy differs by ≤ 5e-5 relative, and on quiescent σ-seamount cases `mont` is 3-5 orders QUIETER. Tests: `test_ocean_pgf_mont`, `test_ocean_pgf_fv` |
| FV-MOM6 in-layer T/S reconstruction (PLM/PPM Boole density integral, BOTH the per-column vertical integral and the 5-point cross-face horizontal one) | `reconstruct_for_pressure=.true.` (+ `recon_scheme=1\|2`) | `&ocean_pgf_nml`; FV_MOM6 only, default off ⇒ PCM bit-identical. **EXACT AT REST**: with a linear EOS and T/S linear in z the face acceleration is round-off (~2e-15 m/s², `C·ε·g·H/dx`) for ANY layer geometry, tilted σ layers included — the defining property of the analytic-FV PGF (Adcroft, Hallberg & Harrison 2008; Yung et al. 2026 §2.4, Fig. 5b→5c). Two pieces are load-bearing and were both missing before 2026-09-20: the boundary layers (k=1, k=nz) take a LINEAR-EXACT one-sided edge pair instead of a PCM flatten (a flatten left the full σ truncation error in exactly the layers next to the tilted boundary), and `intx_dpa`/`inty_dpa` are a 5-point Boole quadrature over sub-columns at the INTERPOLATED interface height instead of the two-column trapezoid `½(dpa_L+dpa_R)` (the trapezoid left the curvature residual `g·(−dρ/dz)·Δe²/12` at every tilted interface — the σ "second-kind" pressure-gradient error, Haney 1991). Measured on a 48×6×15 σ column over a 226→709 m linear bed: PCM 2.59e-8, interior-only reconstruction 9.43e-9, both pieces 9.6e-16 m/s². Costs 5 EOS evaluations per layer + 15 per face per layer — the cross-face rule's `w = 0, 1` end points ARE the two columns, so it reuses their own `dpa` (MOM6 `int_density_dz_generic_plm`; was 25 per face). Under Wright and Roquet the Boole rules run handle-free twins that live in the kernel's module and inline into it (Wright `boole_dpa_intz_layer_wright` / `boole_dpa_face_wright`, density inline; Roquet `roquet_recon_dpa_intz` / `roquet_recon_dpa_face`, the SpV value from the shared include `rdb_roquet_spv.inc`); the linear EOS keeps the generic `eos_t` rule. Every pass — the PLM/PPM edges (`plm_edges_layer` / `ppm_edges_layer`, one layer's edges from its own short stencil), the layer and the face integrals — runs one GPU thread per CELL plus a per-column scan, the same operations in the same order as the column-serial form (global `[stats]` identical to the digit). Global 1° PPM, 5 days, one V100: `ocean_pgf` 3.5 s Wright (was 13.7, then 6.0), 6.6 s Roquet (was 14.6, then 12.4). Tests also: `test_ocean_pgf_eos_fast` (twins vs generic and vs Gauss-Legendre along the PLM/PPM profile, 1 mm to 6000 m layers, surface to 6.1e7 Pa, and across tilted faces; per-layer edges vs the retired per-column routines; end-point reuse vs the 5-sub-column rule) REFUSED under `vcoord_type = "z_fixed"` × `&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml enable` (the top-side fillers' layer means poison the partial top cell's edge build; pending the filler-aware reconstruction). Tests: `test_ocean_pgf_sigma_rest`, `test_ocean_pgf_reconstruct`, `test_ocean_vcoord_hygiene` |
| FV-MOM6 constant-by-layer (PCM) density at its IN-SITU pressure — MOM6 `PressureForce_FV_Bouss` with `RECONSTRUCT_FOR_PRESSURE = False`: each layer's `dpa`/`intz_dpa` is the vertical integral of `EOS(T, S, p = −g·ρ₀·z)` with the layer-mean T/S, and `intx_dpa`/`inty_dpa` the 5-point cross-face Boole integral over sub-columns at the interpolated interface height, T/S interpolated with MOM6's near-bottom mass weighting when `mass_weight`. Under **Wright** the vertical integral is the CLOSED FORM (MOM6 `int_density_dz_wright`, reduced-range coefficients = `rdb_eos`'s; log series in `eps = g·ρ₀·dz/2/(p + p₀ + λ/α₀)`, `wright_pcm_dpa_intz` / `wright_pcm_dpa_face`, coefficients inlined, no `eos_t` dispatch); under **Roquet** it is the 5-point vertical Boole rule of MOM6 `int_density_dz_generic_pcm` (the integrand `1/SV(p)` is rational in depth: no closed form — MOM6 defaults `EOS_QUADRATURE` on for Roquet too), FACTORED: the SpV polynomial's (T, S) part — two sqrt, the PT→CT polynomial, the ~50-term (T, S) sums — once per sub-column, only the degree-6 pressure Horner per Boole point (`roquet_pcm_dpa_intz` / `roquet_pcm_dpa_face`), both halves from the shared include `rdb_roquet_spv.inc` so they inline into the kernel (as an out-of-line call into `rdb_eos` the (T, S) part was a real device call); the five densities are the generic rule's, answers unchanged. Both variants run the layer and face integrals one GPU thread per CELL (3-D `do concurrent` + a per-column scan). The Boole rule the Wright path replaced is accurate to `eps^6`, so the swap moved answers at round-off only (global 1°, 5 days: `[stats]` lines identical, En within 4.4e-9). The legacy branch integrates `ms%rho_layer`, a POTENTIAL density at the single `&ocean_eos_nml p_ref`, so its horizontal density difference at depth is the one at the REFERENCE pressure: Wright's thermal expansion coefficient roughly doubles between the surface and 4000 dbar, and with `p_ref = 0` the deep baroclinic (bottom-)pressure gradient is systematically too weak. On the global 1° WOA13 spin-up (unforced, `z_fixed`) it held Drake Passage at 83 Sv on day 10 where MOM6 adjusts to 152 Sv (MOM6 with `RECONSTRUCT_FOR_PRESSURE = False`: 152 Sv — the reconstruction is not what matters); the transport tracked `p_ref` (0 / 2000 / 4000 dbar: 83 / 143 / 203 Sv), and the in-situ branch gives 152. The trapezoid is not kept: an in-situ density carries the ~4.4e-3 kg m⁻⁴ compressibility gradient, whose curvature residual at a tilted (partial-cell) edge would be signal-sized. Cost (global 1°, 5 days, one V100; `.false.`: `ocean_pgf` 1.09 s, time loop 54.2 s): Wright — one polynomial evaluation per layer + 3 per face per layer, `ocean_pgf` 1.86 s, time loop 55.0 s (the retired Boole path was 10.26 s / 63.4 s); Roquet — 1 (T, S) polynomial + 5 pressure Horners per layer, 3 + 15 per face per layer, `ocean_pgf` 2.55 s, time loop 55.8 s, 1.36× Wright (generic Boole: 10.73 s / 63.9 s; factored with an out-of-line (T, S) call: 3.64 s / 56.9 s). `benchmark_ale` (Roquet, CPU gfortran, 8 steps): PGF 33.1 → 6.5 s factored → 4.9 s with the kernel loops vectorised (the helpers inline — `src/CMakeLists.txt` raises gfortran's inlining budget for this one source) | `insitu_density=.true.` (**default**, MOM6 parity) | `&ocean_pgf_nml`; FV_MOM6 with `reconstruct_for_pressure = .false.` and a PRESSURE-DEPENDENT EOS (`wright`, `roquet_spv`) only — for `linear` in-situ = potential density and the legacy branch runs, byte-identical. `.false.` restores the legacy potential-density integral. REFUSED with `&ocean_psurf_nml in_eos` (its EOS pressure is `−g·ρ₀·z`, not yet offset by `p_top`). Tests: `test_ocean_pgf_wright_analytic` (closed-form layer + face integrals vs 64-panel Gauss-Legendre of the generic EOS, surface to 6000 m, 1 mm to 6000 m layers: 3.5e-15 of `g·ρ₀·dz`; vs the retired 5-point Boole ≤ 5.3e-10, the 6000 m layer), `test_ocean_pgf_eos_fast` (factored Roquet layer vs 64-panel Gauss-Legendre: 1.1e-13 of `g·ρ₀·dz` for layers ≤ 1000 m, 8.0e-10 for the 6000 m column as one layer — the Boole truncation; vs the generic Boole path: 0 layer and face), `test_ocean_pgf_insitu` (thermobaric σ₀-compensated columns: in-situ error 1.6e-15 against an independent fine-trapezoid oracle of 5.7e-5 m/s², legacy misses all of it; partial-cell steps at rest 5e-18 m/s² with and without mass weighting; linear EOS bit-identical; `open_step_filler_faces_{pcm,plm,ppm}`: a live layer facing a bed filler across an OPEN step, the case `zstar` and closed-faces-off `z_fixed` produce. Both this branch and the reconstruction read a vanished layer's T/S as its I1′ donor concentration (Pass C, one per-column sweep into `conc_T`/`conc_S`), never `hS/max(h, H_VANISHED)`: the floored read is `h/H_VANISHED` of the truth, and the cross-face Boole rule integrates it over the interpolated LIVE thickness. Measured at rest: 2.87e-3 m/s² before, 1.36e-6 after, independent of the filler thickness to 4.5e-7 relative) |
| Top-of-column load in the FV-MOM6 pressure-stack surface BC (P5.0, ice-shelf-cavity prerequisite) — `pa(nz+1) = ρ_ref·g·η_geo + ms%p_top` instead of `ρ_ref·g·η_geo`. Reaches BOTH the PCM and the `reconstruct_for_pressure` branch (same Pass-1 seed, same face assembly). NOT a double count of the barotropic `eta_forcing` seam: a depth-uniform `p_top` perturbs EVERY layer's `PFu` by the same `−(1/ρ₀)∇p_top` (theorem in the `compute_fv_mom6_impl` docstring), and under the default split (`&ocean_bt_nml bc_pgf_forcing`) that depth mean forces the barotropic mode, so the `p_surf` part is shed from the forcing as `g·∇η_ib` (the seam carries it once) and the static `p_ice_ref` part cancels inside `pa(nz+1)` against the datum-shifted `η_geo`. On the UNSPLIT driver there is neither replacement nor seam, so the term is the load's only path into the momentum. What it buys where the load is large: `pa` is an anomaly stack about `ρ_ref·g·z`, so cancelling the load inside `pa(nz+1)` keeps the stack `O(1e4 Pa)` instead of `O(5e6 Pa)` and shrinks the `h_neglect` face-divisor leak by the same factor. `ms%p_top` has TWO producers that SUM — the `&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml` static ice load and the `&ocean_psurf_nml` seam (per-step refresh gate is the DISJUNCTION `in_eos .or. p_top_in_bc`, so neither consumer can read a stale value; a cavity without psurf needs no refresh, its configure seed being final); with neither producer the knob is inert and says so. REQUIRED, fail-loud, for a cavity whose draft varies. `compute_pbce` is deliberately load-blind (`pbce = ∂p_k/∂η`, and a static load has no `∂/∂η`). Orthogonal to `&ocean_psurf_nml in_eos` — that is the EOS pressure ARGUMENT, this is the PGF pressure BOUNDARY CONDITION | `p_top_in_bc=.true.` | `&ocean_pgf_nml`; FV_MOM6 only (fail-loud at configure otherwise — mont hard-zeroes `M(nz)`, fv_lite/fv_wright seed `p_edge(nz+1)=0`), default off ⇒ byte-identical. Test: `test_ocean_pgf_p_top_bc` |
| Reference densities — the Boussinesq divisor `ρ₀` (`du/dt = −(1/ρ₀)∂p/∂x`, every variant) and the FV-MOM6 anomaly baseline `ρ_ref` (`pa(top) = ρ_ref·g·η`, layer anomaly `(ρ_k−ρ_ref)·g·h`; also `compute_pbce`'s `g·ρ_ref/ρ₀`) | not separately settable — both take `&ocean_ic_nml rho_0` | Kept as two members (the roles differ; interchanging them is a known MOM6 bug class) but sourced from the ONE configured ρ₀ via `eos%rho0` in `configure_ocean_pgf` — the same scalar the EOS, EPBL, kappa-shear, tidal mixing, wave speed, the `η_ib` surface-pressure seam, GM/MEKE/Redi/MLE and the isopycnal slopes take. Before that wiring the slot kept a hard-coded 1035 while the EOS followed the namelist, so `rho_0 /= 1035` ran the EOS and the pressure gradient on two different reference densities, silently. Default `rho_0 = 1035` ⇒ bit-identical. Test: `test_ocean_pgf_rho_ref` |
| Grounded-layer gate (zero the face PGF where the layer's z-extents do not overlap across the face AND the layer is at the floor, `<= 2·max(angstrom_h, H_VANISHED)`, on one side) | `pgf_skip_nonoverlap=.true.` | `&ocean_isopycnal_nml`; **default ON**, applied under `VCOORD_LAGRANGIAN` only ⇒ every other vcoord bit-identical. Covers `mont`/`fv_lite`/`fv_wright`/`fv_mom6` (`gprime` N/A — it warns); on `fv_mom6` the `z_centre` buffer is allocated for this gate alone, so the flag is latched before the PGF slot is initialised. Without it a grounded isopycnal layer leaves `g·(ρ_layer−ρ̄_ambient)·∂z/∂x` of PGF **at rest** — `test_ocean_pgf_grounded`. The floor condition keeps it off layers that are massive on both sides but merely disjoint in z (a sigma-seeded stack over a step), whose PGF it used to zero, growing `En` to the CFL panic — `test_ocean_pgf_grounded :: gate_spares_massive_nonoverlapping_layers`, `test_ocean_lagrangian_staircase` |

## Coriolis

| Scheme | ocean | Knob |
|---|---|---|
| Sadourny PV-flux (enstrophy, velocity form) | `form="sadourny"` | ocean default |
| Sadourny energy-conserving (transport form q·vh) | `form="sadourny_energy"` | MOM6 SADOURNY75_ENERGY; faithful |
| Sadourny + Hollingsworth-Källén guard | `form="sadourny_hk"` | Arakawa-Hsu PV stencil. Under `&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces` its passes 5/6 run a **pair-floored** twin: every PV in a pair coefficient is evaluated at a corner thickness of at least half the larger face thickness of its (u-face, v-face) pair, `q → (f+ζ)/max(h_corner, max(h_U,h_V)/2)`. Without it the HK "cross" pairs (a corner PV times a transport whose far cell lies outside that corner) carry an unbounded `h_face/h_corner`, which a `z_fixed` staircase (a live partial bottom cell as thin as `H_VANISHED` against a full level across an OPEN face) turns into a runaway: 1-degree Southern Ocean NaN at step 11, where `sadourny` (velocity form, no `1/h`) and `sadourny_energy` (each corner only meets transports whose two cells it contains ⇒ `h_corner ≥ h_face/2`) run clean. The floor imposes exactly that energy-form bound, `|CA| ≤ 2·|f+ζ|·|v|`; it belongs to the PAIR, so the coefficient symmetry behind HK energy conservation is kept, and it is a bitwise no-op wherever no cell outweighs the other three of its corner. The same twin runs with the knob OFF on the coordinates that lay static bed fillers (`z_fixed`, `zstar`, `zstar_full`; latch `coriolis_adv_t%hk_pair_floor`, set at configure): over a stepped bed their open faces pair a live cell with a `1e-4 m` filler, and unguarded the compat-matrix staircase (`zstar` × `sadourny_hk`) left the remap a negative layer at step 2. Every other coordinate ⇒ the original passes, byte-identical. Test: `test_ocean_coriolis_hk_vanished` (`open_step_latch_is_bounded`) |
| BOUND_CORIOLIS velocity-form clamp (energy scheme) | `bound_coriolis` (default off; `form="sadourny_energy"` only, fail-loud) | MOM6 `BOUND_CORIOLIS`; clamps CAu/CAv into the `(f+ζ)·v` range before the KE-grad subtraction. **Inert on all-wet columns** (Roundabout's cell-mean corner-h ⇒ PV flux already convex-bounded; MOM6's `hArea_q` telescopes identically ⇒ MOM6's clamp is inert too); engages only at land-masked / floored corners. H200 rim A/B: NULL |
| PV corner-thickness construction (energy scheme) | `corner_h` (default `"cell_mean"`; `"mom6_area"` `form="sadourny_energy"` only, fail-loud) | MOM6's area-weighted PV form. **Algebraically identical to `cell_mean` above the `H_MIN_PV` floor** (same `Σarea·h`/`Σarea`); differs only in the vanishing-thickness guard (MOM6 `vol_neglect` = pure 1/0 armor, no cap). Round-off no-op for `h≳1e-12`; predicted inert for the dt=800 disease |

## Outer time-split scheme (`&ocean_bt_nml split_scheme`)

Selects the OUTER (baroclinic) integrator that wraps the barotropic fast
loop. Both schemes ship and both are under test; the stability suite runs an
`ssp_rk2` twin of every case whose namelist does not pin a scheme.

| Scheme | ocean | What it does | Primary test |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pred_corr` | **`default`** | MOM6 predictor-corrector: `pc_be`-off-centred predictor, slow tendencies on the `u_av`/`h_av` step time-means, ONE prognostic update in the corrector, forward-backward gravity-wave pairing. Neutrally stable to `ω·dt = 2`. `validate_config` refuses it FAIL-LOUD outside its v1 envelope (`eulerian_z`, wet/dry, `dt_tracer_advect_ratio > 1`) — those configurations must pin `ssp_rk2` | `test_ocean_pred_corr`, `test_ocean_cor_ref_seiche` |
| `ssp_rk2` | `split_scheme = "ssp_rk2"` — **EXPERIMENTAL** | Two identical stages + SSP average. Widest envelope: the only scheme that takes `eulerian_z`, `&ocean_wetdry_nml enable` and `dt_tracer_advect_ratio > 1`. **Amplifies internal gravity waves by `√(1+(ω·dt)⁴/4)` per step** — see the note below. Fully supported and fully tested; *experimental* labels the ANSWER, not the code path | `test_ocean_dyn_split`, `test_ocean_analytical` |
| Fast-loop gravity-wave damping (MOM6 `BEBT`) | `bebt = 0.1` — **default** (MOM6's default; `0.0` = neutral forward-backward) | The barotropic continuity flux uses `ubt_trans = (1+bebt)·ubt^n − bebt·ubt^{n-1}` (MOM6's `BT_PROJECT_VELOCITY` spelling). η is updated BEFORE the velocity in this loop, so the scheme is algebraically MOM6's DEFAULT path (`BT_PROJECT_VELOCITY=.false.`: predictor η, then `(1−bebt)·ubt^n + bebt·ubt^{n+1}` transport) — this loop's η is MOM6's `eta_pred`, the velocity sequence is identical, and the per-substep amplification of a gravity wave is MOM6's: `|λ|² = 1 − bebt·a²` (`a = c·dt_bt·k_eff`), stable for `a ≤ 2/√(1+2·bebt)`. At `bebt = 0` nothing in the fast loop damps the barotropic grid-scale gravity mode (under `pred_corr` the Laplacian viscosity acts only through `u_av`) — the mode FINDING B of the vertical-coordinate matrix pumped. Residual differences from MOM6: the time-mean `ubt` averages `ubt`, not `ubt_trans`; the end-of-loop η/transport differ by `bebt·(ubt^N − ubt^{N−1})`-sized terms; `auto_n_inner` does not carry MOM6 `set_dtbt`'s `1+2·BEBT` factor (`cfl_bt_safety = 0.65` sits inside the tightened limit up to `bebt ≈ 0.68`). Default `0.1` since 2026-09-22 (was `0.0`); shipped namelists that set `bebt` explicitly (mostly `0.2`) keep their value | `test_ocean_barotropic_substep` (`bebt_*`) |
| Barotropic forcing by the depth-mean baroclinic PGF (MOM6 `BT_force` + `eta_PF`) | `bc_pgf_forcing = .true.` — **default** (`.false.` = legacy split) | The substep's frozen forcing keeps the depth mean of the FULL slow layer PGF and sheds only the free-surface term that PGF itself carries at the stage-entry η: `F_bt_fast = F_bt + g_pf·∇(η_PF − η_ib)` (`set_fast_forcing_eta_pf`), `g_pf = 0` for the surface-relative MONT / FV_LITE / FV_WRIGHT forms, `gfs_scale·g·ρ_ref/ρ₀` for FV_MOM6, `g_FS` for GPRIME (`pgf_free_surface_gravity`); `η_ib` only when `p_top_in_bc` puts `p_surf` in the PGF too. The legacy split subtracted the WHOLE depth-mean PGF, which is `−g∇η` only for a barotropic pressure field: the baroclinic bottom-pressure gradient (JEBAR) never reached the depth mean — 0.2 Sv through Drake Passage on day 1 of the global 1° WOA13 spin-up where MOM6 surges to −188 Sv (with the fix: −198 Sv). Both schemes | `test_ocean_bt_baroclinic_forcing` (analytic `−gH∂ₓρ/2ρ₀` to 0.1–0.4 %, both schemes × MONT/FV_MOM6, + the legacy control at ratio 4e-7) |
| Per-layer bc-PGF retro-correction (MOM6 `btstep_layer_accel`) | `correction_bc_pgf = .true.` (default off) | `compute_pbce` builds the per-layer pressure response `pbce = ∂p_k/∂η` from the FV-MOM6 interface-height stack `pgf%e_face` and `compute_gtot_faces` its face-centred depth means. `apply_bt_correction` then gives each layer `−(pbce − gtot)·∇(η − η_PF)`, which is depth-mean-zero. **Requires `&ocean_pgf_nml form = "fv_mom6"`**. No other form fills `e_face`, and the MONT / FV_LITE / FV_WRIGHT forms are surface-relative (`g_pf = 0`). Since 2026-10-04 `validate_config` refuses it with any other form, and so does `configure_ocean_pgf` for API callers. Before that it was accepted and `error stop`ped in step 1; the compatibility matrix found it (`bc_pgf_needs_fv_mom6`). Also refused under `&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces` | `test_ocean_pgf_p_top_bc` (`validate_config_correction_bc_pgf`), `test_ocean_zfixed_closed_faces` (`refuses_correction_bc_pgf`) |
| Fast-loop Coriolis reference (`Cor_ref`, MOM6 `ubt_Cor`) | `default` (scheme-derived) | `subtract_fast_cor_ref` removes the barotropic Coriolis/advection already frozen into `F_bt` so the substep does not integrate it twice. The reference velocity `bt_work%cor_ref_u/v` is built by `set_cor_ref_velocity` from the SAME velocity the slow `cor%pv_flux_*` was evaluated on — the stage-entry `bt_ubt/bt_vbt` under `ssp_rk2`, the depth mean of `u_av/v_av` under `pred_corr`, weighted exactly as the forcing depth-mean was (h, or h·visc_rem under `forcing_visc_rem`). Mismatch them and the residual `f × (v̄_ref − v̄_slow)` forces every substep and pumps the basin's gravest Poincaré seiche. Under `pred_corr` `u_av` itself obeys the land contract: its step-0 seed is masked (`mask_time_mean_velocities`, static `wet` × z-level `open`), because its only later writer, the renormaliser's `u_cor`, never writes a masked face. A non-zero masked-face `u_av` is read by the reference but NOT by the `sadourny_energy`/`sadourny_hk` transports (their `vh` rides `dx_cv = 0`), so it forced `−(f/4)·(v̄_av(i−1)+v̄_av(i))` on the wall-adjacent rows: `KE+PE` ×126 in 1200 steps on a masked-wall basin from an unmasked seed, 0.892 after (`energy_form_masked_walls_no_growth`). Configured runs mask their IC at setup, so they were never exposed and are byte-identical | `test_ocean_bt_cor_ref`, `test_ocean_cor_ref_seiche` |
| Barotropic-correction fold weight (MOM6 `u_accel_bt`) | uniform — **the only form** (PR-3 D1 revised: `correction_visc_rem`, the knob that used to switch to a visc_rem-weighted form, is RETIRED) | `apply_bt_correction` adds `Δ·wt_k` to every layer, `Δ = ubt_end − ubt_at_n − dt·F_bt`, `wt ≡ open_k` (`open` only under `zfixed_closed_faces`, else `wt ≡ 1`): the same increment in every layer, MOM6's `accel_layer_u(I,j,k) = u_accel_bt(I,j)` exactly, whose column KE change is exactly the barotropic `H(ūΔ + Δ²/2)`. **`correction_visc_rem` is RETIRED** (fail-loud at configure): it used to weight this fold by `vr_k/⟨vr⟩_h`, biasing the Δu distribution against implicit-drag/BBL-damped layers — but MOM6's `accel_layer_u` (`MOM_barotropic.F90:3665-3675`) never weights this fold (every layer gets the SAME `u_accel_bt`, folded into `up` BEFORE `vertvisc` distributes it through the glue's own implicit friction), so the weighted form double-damped: measured on the 1-degree Southern Ocean z* OPEN-step case (`&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces=.false.`), `hvel_mom6`+`bbl_glue`+`implicit_drag` alone runs clean while adding ONLY `correction_visc_rem` NaNs at step 38 (the unbounded `vr_k/⟨vr⟩_h` ratio when a column's glue damping is uneven across layers). **PR-3 (D1):** `&ocean_bt_nml visc_rem_chain = .true.` is ONE switch for the visc_rem PRODUCER (decoupled from the retired weighted fold — runs whenever ANY of the three knobs below is on) plus `forcing_visc_rem` + `renorm_visc_rem` + `bt_rem_from_visc_rem` all at once (never a superset) — this fold stays UNIFORM under the chain, matching MOM6. `&ocean_vdiff_nml accel_visc_rem` — which used to read the same (then-coupled) producer — is likewise **RETIRED** (refused at configure): PR-3's audit found no MOM6 state-update equivalent (`btstep_layer_accel` applies the depth-mean `u_accel_bt` uniformly across every layer, no `visc_rem` weight); the real MOM6 `visc_rem x velocity` mechanisms are `renorm_visc_rem` (next row) and `rescale_strong_drag`. MOM6's `accel_layer_u` also ALWAYS adds the depth-mean-zero `pbce` baroclinic term on top of the uniform `u_accel_bt` (every PGF form); roundabout only adds the equivalent under `correction_bc_pgf` + `form='fv_mom6'` (`compute_pbce` has no other form's interface-height stack) — a reported, unfixed general fidelity gap (not implicated in the NaN: no probe that reproduced or cleared it had `correction_bc_pgf` on). **`correction_h_weighted` is RETIRED** (2026-10-02, refused at configure with the reason on the error ring): `wt = h/⟨h⟩_h` adds, beyond the barotropic `ΔKE`, a positive-definite `½Δ²H(κ−1)` (`κ = Σh³Σh/(Σh²)² ≥ 1`) plus a shear feedback `Δ·Σh·u′·(wt−1)` that the fold keeps reinforcing. Measured with a per-term probe on the 1-degree Southern Ocean (50-level tanh `z_fixed`, `κ−1 ≈ 0.2`): the feedback ran 15-28× the source, KE ×7.7 over base by day 10 and non-finite on day 16 (`visc_rem` chain: abort step 688); `z_fixed_profile = "uniform"` (equal open layers, `κ = 1`) made it match base, which is what located it in the weight, not the staircase. MOM6 has no h-weighted fold (`frhatu·visc_rem` is its AVERAGING weight). Uniform default ⇒ byte-identical | `test_ocean_bt_correction_weight`, `test_ocean_visc_rem` |
| BT-substep damping from the viscous remnant (PR-2 bt-rem-from-av-rem, MOM6 `MOM_barotropic.F90:1553-1580`) | `1.0` no-op — **default**; `&ocean_bt_nml bt_rem_from_visc_rem = .true.` ⇒ `bt_rem_u/v` from `av_rem` | `compute_bt_rem_from_visc_rem` builds `av_rem_u/v = Σ_k frhat_k·visc_rem_k` (`frhat_k = h_face_k/Σ_k h_face_k`, the PLAIN face-thickness fraction `derive_bt_from_layers` uses — reused via `face_depth_mean_u/v(visc_rem_u/v, h_layer)`, NOT `forcing_visc_rem`'s `h·visc_rem` weight) once per barotropic call, before the inner substeps, then `bt_rem = av_rem**(1/n_inner)` where `av_rem > 0` else `0` (no `max(…,eps)` floor substitute — the `av_rem > 0` check IS the MOM6 mask). `strong_drag` (MOM6 `BT_STRONG_DRAG`, default off) swaps in the rational form `n_inner·av_rem/(1+(n_inner−1)·av_rem)`; `rescale_strong_drag` (MOM6 `RESCALE_STRONG_DRAG`, default off, requires `strong_drag`) rescales `apply_bt_correction`'s Δu/Δv by `min(bt_rem**n_inner/av_rem, 1.0)` to correct for the rational form's `bt_rem**n_inner ≠ av_rem` gap. This is the fix for the MOM6 BOTTOMDRAGLAW glue (`&ocean_vdiff_nml bbl_glue`) day-253 1° Southern Ocean instability: without it the barotropic solver sees only the weak explicit drag in `F_slow` while the layers are strongly glued, so the fast mode is undamped where the slow mode is heavily damped. `av_rem`/`bt_rem` are built on the FULL face extent including ghosts (halo-valid after the PR-1 `visc_rem_halo_refresh`), so the chain is decomposition-invariant. Self-sufficient (PR-3 D1 revised): the visc_rem producer runs whenever this knob is on, decoupled from the retired `correction_visc_rem`. Mutually exclusive with `substep_drag` (double-counted bed drag) and `bt_halo > 0` (no av_rem/visc_rem ghost-width statistics on the wide-halo clone, like porous); `strong_drag` requires `bt_rem_from_visc_rem`; `rescale_strong_drag` requires `strong_drag`. Composes with `wave_drag` (multiplied in after). **PR-3 (D1):** every one of those is also satisfied by `&ocean_bt_nml visc_rem_chain = .true.` (an equivalent subset, see the row above) — D2/D3 compose identically through the chain switch. Default off ⇒ byte-identical | `test_ocean_bt_rem_from_visc_rem`, `test_ocean_bt_correction_weight` |

**Why `ssp_rk2` is labelled EXPERIMENTAL — the number.** On
`validation_examples/ocean/eady/resting_stratified_channel.nml` — flat bed,
periodic, stably stratified, at rest, ±0.5 mK seed, **no energy source** —
`ssp_rk2` manufactures **En = 2.992E-05 m²/s²** by day 25 (7.7 mm/s rms) and
is still climbing on a 2.5-day e-folding; `pred_corr` on the identical file
holds **1.739E-09** (17 000×, 83-day e-folding). The outer split is the
cause: the Coriolis form, the ALE remap and the PGF form were each
substituted and each moved the answer < 0.1 %; `dT/dz = 0` dropped En 119×;
removing the lateral viscosity RAISED it. It is a `(ω·dt)⁴` noise floor, so
a forced, energetic, viscous run sits decades above it and never notices,
while a quiescent or long-spin-up one does not. The suite carries it as a
scoped XFAIL on `resting_stratified_channel__ssp_rk2` — **do not close it by
raising `en_rest_max`**.  `ssp_rk2` stays supported and stays on the scheme
axis; the label tells you what choosing it costs, it does not deprecate it.

**`pred_corr` became the default on 2026-09-14.** Its GPU path is clean:
the seven failures that retargeting the dyn-core unit suite onto it used to
leave on the **NVHPC GPU build only** (`periodic`, `obc_baroclinic`,
`dyn_split`, `ice_restart`, `wetdry` non-finite within 1-5 steps, plus
`restart` bit-exactness and `p_surf` gauge invariance) had one cause —
`scratch_3d_buffer_t` attached uninitialised device memory and the pred_corr
predictor reads `du_visc`/`dv_visc` without recomputing them — and the suite
is 187/187 on both toolchains. It still does NOT eliminate the resting-state
growth, only slows it ~36× (83-day e-folding), which is why
`resting_stratified_channel` remains a scoped XFAIL on the settle gate under
the default too. Its per-step cost is ~7 % over `ssp_rk2`. Full detail in
[`CAPABILITIES_AND_LIMITATIONS.md`](CAPABILITIES_AND_LIMITATIONS.md) and the
`split_scheme` docstring in `rdb_config.F90`.

## Vertical coordinates (dispatch via `vcoord_type`)

| Coord | ocean |
|---|---|
| Sigma | `"sigma"` |
| Z-sigma hybrid | `"zsigma"` — **REFUSED at configure**: the deep branch reads `z_ref_global` as metres while its only writer fills it with the dimensionless `k/nz`, so every z-level interval is `1/nz` m and the whole column collapses into the bed layer (with `Σ = H + η` still exact). Returns when the table is filled in metres — `test_ocean_vcoord_hygiene :: zsigma_is_refused`, `test_ocean_vcoord_interface_depths :: documents_zsigma_dimensionless_zref_collapse` |
| Z-star (MOM6 z\*) | `"zstar"` (alias `zstar_lite`) — MOM6 `REGRIDDING_COORDINATE_MODE = "Z*"`: the `z_fixed` nominal profile (`max_depth/nz` or `&vcoord_nml z_fixed_profile`) dilated per column by `(H + η)/H` over `z_fixed`'s partial bed cell and `zstar_h_min` fillers; liveness decided at `η = 0` ⇒ exactly static pattern, `η = 0` target = `z_fixed`'s bit for bit, `zfixed_closed_faces` accepted. Refused under a cavity and with wet/dry. Until 2026-10 it was the sigma branch.

The ONLY z-like family legal under an ice-shelf cavity: there it reads `vcoord%z_top = metrics%z_draft`, vanishes the layers that outcrop into the ice to the same inert filler, and cuts the first live layer at the ice base into a partial top cell (min `0.1*h_nominal`, else the sliver merges into the layer below). `z_top = 0` ⇒ bit-identical. Under a cavity the top-side consumers read `multilayer_state_t%k_top(i,j)` (+ the `min`-rule face twins `k_top_u`/`k_top_v`), the first LIVE layer counting down, filled once at configure from the same `η = 0` target the closed-face mask uses and falling back to `nz` wherever nothing vanishes against the top: melt heat/salt/mass, top drag (and hence `stress_shelf` and the under-ice `u_*`), the implicit stress/drag folds and the momentum surface row, `mld_density`. Its bed-side mirror `multilayer_state_t%k_bot(i,j)` (+ `max`-rule face twins `k_bot_u`/`k_bot_v`, the first LIVE layer counting UP, built from the same target on EVERY `z_fixed` run — not only under a cavity — and `≡ 1` wherever nothing vanishes against the bed) is read by the bed-side consumers: bottom drag (bed-only, HBBL band, implicit-fold rate), the vdiff bed row (+ `bbl_glue` piston and its height-above-bed stack), geothermal, the tidal-mixing bed anchor, the MEKE bed speed, the bed-reaching shortwave residual (+ EPBL's SW ledger) and the BT budget probe; test `test_ocean_zfixed_k_bot`. Cavity envelope: melt and top drag are ACCEPTED; `kappa_h /= 0` is accepted iff `&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces` (the face mask zeroes every flux touching a filler); KPP, EPBL, ideal age, GM/Redi/slopes, kappa-shear, tidal mixing, `regrid_time_scale > 0` and `&ocean_pgf_nml reconstruct_for_pressure` (the PLM/PPM edge build reads the fillers as neighbouring water; ISOMIP+ Ocean0 melt-off spins up a spurious `En ~ 1E-03` from rest within 3 hours, ~19 000× the layer-mean run — pending the filler-aware reconstruction) still fail loud. `&ocean_hvisc_nml nu_h < 2` WARNS (never refused): on Ocean0 `nu_h = 0` carries an inviscid mode growing at 0.18 /day; the melt-OFF baseline and its two regimes are in `docs/CAPABILITIES_AND_LIMITATIONS.md`.

### ALE remap reconstruction (dispatch via `remap_method`)

The conservative integrate-and-redistribute is shared across all coords; only
the per-column reconstruction order changes. All methods conserve column
integrals to roundoff and are monotone (no new extrema).

| Method | `remap_method` | Order | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Piecewise constant | `"pcm"` | 0th | donor cell, diffusive |
| Piecewise linear | `"plm"` | 1st | minmod-limited |
| Piecewise parabolic | `"ppm"` (`default`) | 2nd | Colella & Woodward 1984; uniform-grid `(7/12,−1/12)` edge estimate |
| PPM, non-uniform H4 edges | `"ppm_h4"` | 2nd (parabola) + 4th edges | thickness-weighted (White & Adcroft 2008) edge estimate — holds 4th order on non-uniform ALE layers where PPM degrades to 2nd; cuts spurious diapycnal mixing (Ilicak 2012). Reuses the PPM limiter + parabola + redistribute verbatim. Boundary edges: PCM-outermost + 3-cell H3 (cubic-fit upgrade deferred to PQM). |
| Piecewise quartic (PQM) | `"pqm"` | 4th–5th | White & Adcroft (2008) PQM_IH4IH3: implicit-h4 edge values + implicit-h3 edge slopes (per-column tridiagonal solves) → degree-4 reconstruction + W&A monotonicity limiter; prototype shows ~5th-order convergence (vs PPM ~2nd) on smooth profiles, ~10–20× lower remap error. Conservative + monotone. `N<5` falls back to PPM. ~98 regs (no spill); cadence-bounded. Opt-in (PPM stays default). |

#### Boundary-cell closure (`remap_boundary_extrap`) — orthogonal to the order above

Every reconstruction above PCM needs a stencil the outermost cells do not
have. By default — matching MOM6 `BOUNDARY_EXTRAPOLATION = False` — `k=1`
and `k=nz` collapse to PCM, so **the remap is first-order in the two cells
next to the bed and the surface whichever method is selected**: PLM, PPM,
PPM_H4 and PQM share the closure and remap a linear-in-z profile with the
same O(h) error there, while their interiors are already exact for it.

| Knob | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `&vcoord_nml remap_boundary_extrap` | `.false.` (bit-identical) | `.true.` ⇒ the boundary cells take the linear-exact one-sided edge pair `q ± dq_up·h_self/(h_self+h_nbr)` (`boundary_half_jump`, the remap-side twin of the FV PGF's `boundary_edges_linear`), making the whole column exact for a profile linear in z. Inert for `"pcm"` — there is no reconstruction to close. |

**Why it matters.** A stratified ocean at rest has a tracer profile linear
in z, and under a terrain-following coordinate the ALE remap runs on it
every thermo step. The first-order boundary closure therefore injects a
spurious diapycnal tracer flux into those two layers on every step; over a
slope it differs between neighbouring columns, which is a horizontal
density gradient, which is a pressure-gradient force — and with rotation it
feeds a growing grid mode trapped in exactly those layers. Measured on an
undamped 48×6×15 σ-over-slope rest case (bed 226 → 709 m, f-plane 75 °S,
exact FV pressure gradient, zero viscosity/drag/mixing):

| closure | `σ_En` (days 10–45) | En at day 45 |
|---|---|---|
| default (PCM flatten) — `ppm`, `plm`, `ppm_h4`, `pqm` | 0.353–0.355 /day | 1.6–1.7E-20 |
| `remap_boundary_extrap = .true.` — `ppm` / `plm` / `pqm` | 0.042–0.047 /day | 3.9–4.7E-25 |
| no remap at all (`vcoord_type = "lagrangian"`) | 0.046 /day | 1.5E-25 |
| `remap_method = "pcm"` (knob inert) | 0.875 /day | 7.9E-13 |

i.e. with the knob on, the mode's growth rate falls to the no-remap floor.
Gate: `test_remap_boundary_extrap` (four exactness cases FAIL with the
default closure, by construction).

#### Non-uniform-grid weights (`remap_nonuniform_weights`) — also orthogonal

The boundary closure above buys linear exactness only for a **uniform**
source column. PLM's `0.5·minmod(Δq_l, Δq_r)` slope and PPM's
`(7/12, −1/12)` edge estimate are the **equal-thickness specialisations** of
Colella & Woodward (1984) eqs (1.6)–(1.8), so on a **stretched** source
column — which is what every geometric family but σ-on-a-flat-bed hands the
remap — they carry an O(Δh/h) error through the whole **interior**, not just
at the two boundary cells. `"ppm_h4"` and `"pqm"` already carry
thickness-weighted stencils and are unaffected.

| Knob | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `&vcoord_nml remap_nonuniform_weights` | `.false.` (bit-identical) | `.true.` ⇒ PPM takes the CW84 (1.6) edge value on the true stencil thicknesses (with the unlimited (1.7) jump, so it reduces **exactly** to `(7/12, −1/12)` on a uniform column), and PLM takes the CW84 (1.7)+(1.8) h-weighted slope (MOM6 `PLM_slope_cw`). Inert for `"pcm"`; reaches `"ppm_h4"`/`"pqm"` only through their small-`nz` fallbacks. |

Measured on random stretched columns (`nz = 12`, `h` uniform on [0.5, 6.5] m,
`dq/dz = 0.25`, `remap_boundary_extrap = .true.`), max |q_new − q_exact| on a
profile linear in z:

| method | knob off | knob on |
|---|---|---|
| `plm` | 1.5E-01 | 2.8E-14 |
| `ppm` | 1.7E-01 | 4.3E-14 |
| `ppm_h4` | 5.0E-14 | 5.0E-14 (already exact) |
| `pqm` | 5.2E-14 | 5.2E-14 (already exact) |

**One caveat worth reading before turning it on.** PPM reduces exactly on a
uniform column, PLM does **not**: CW84 (1.7) there is the *centred*
difference under the (1.8) bound, where the shipped kernel uses the strictly
more diffusive minmod. So the knob swaps PLM's limiter as well as its
weighting and moves the `plm` answer even with no stretching — still
monotone, still conservative, now linear-exact. Gate:
`test_remap_nonuniform` (`uniform_source_plm_swaps_limiter` pins exactly
that, and `knob_off_is_first_order` pins the defect the knob removes).

## Tracer advection & reconstruction schemes

Tracer transport has three distinct reconstruction jobs — horizontal tracer
advection, vertical (in-z) advection, and the conservative ALE vertical remap.
They are *separate code paths* even when they share a paper, so this section
lists the primitives, then the regime × backend matrix, then the knobs.

### (a) Reconstruction primitives

All PPM rows cite Colella & Woodward 1984; MUSCL is Barth-Jespersen-limited
Green-Gauss (van Leer-class). "Order" is the formal spatial order of the
reconstruction.

| Primitive | file:line | Order | One-line | Paper |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PCM remap (`remap_column_pcm`) | `src/ALE/rdb_remap_column.F90:73` | 0th (donor) | donor cell, diffusive, monotone | — |
| PLM remap (`remap_column_plm`) | `:131` | 1st | minmod-limited linear | van Leer 1979 |
| PPM remap (`remap_column_ppm`) | `:227` | 2nd | piecewise parabolic, C-W limiter | Colella & Woodward 1984 |
| PQM remap (`remap_column_pqm`) | `src/ALE/rdb_remap_column.F90` | 4th–5th | piecewise quartic, implicit h4 values + h3 slopes + W&A limiter; `N<5`→PPM | White & Adcroft 2008 |
| ALE remap dispatcher (`remap_column`) | `:48` | — | `select case(method)`; **unknown tag → PLM** (`:68-69`) | — |
| Ocean continuity PPM slope (`ppm_limited_slope`) | `src/core/ocean/kernels/continuity_ppm/rdb_continuity.F90:1645` | 2nd | van-Leer MC slope for the parabola | C-W 1984 |
| Ocean continuity PPM cell limiter (`ppm_cell_limiter`) | `:1669` | 2nd | C-W eq 1.10 monotonic limiter | C-W 1984 |
| Ocean positivity limiter (`ppm_limit_pos`) | `:1696` | — | positivity *modifier* on the PPM face values | — |
| Ocean positive-definite outflux limiter (`pd_limit_zonal_impl`/`pd_limit_meridional_impl`) | `src/core/ocean/kernels/continuity_ppm/rdb_continuity.F90` | — | per-donor θ scaling of outgoing layer mass flux ⇒ `h ≥ h_lim`, **zero mass created** (contrast: MOM6's injecting `max(h,Angstrom)` clamp is NOT ported); + a `2·h_lim` PPM edge floor (`:467/:514` parity) | — |
| Barotropic transport renormalisation (`renormalise_zonal_flux_to_uhbt` / `renormalise_meridional_flux_to_vhbt`) | `src/core/ocean/kernels/continuity_ppm/rdb_continuity.F90` | — | Newton on a uniform `du` so `Σ_k uh_k = uhbt`, donor re-picked per iteration, CFL-bracketed. `&ocean_continuity_nml renorm_consistent_flux` (**default on** since 2026-09-22, MOM6 behaviour; `.false.` restores the historical model): a layer whose donor FLIPS carries `(u0+du)·h_face(new donor)` instead of the historical `flux0 + du·h_face(new donor)` — which jumps by `u0·(h_new−h_old)` at the flip and has NO root when `uhbt` lands in the gap (a wrong-sign layer transport at a thickness jump, e.g. sigma over a bathymetric step; the layer `η` then leaves the barotropic `η_end`) — and bisects when Newton leaves its bracket (MOM6 `zonal_flux_adjust`). Unflipped layers keep the historical expression, so a face with no flip is bit-identical either way | `test_continuity_multilayer` (`renorm_donor_flip_*`, `renorm_consistent_flux_no_flip_bit_identical`), `test_ocean_step_bt_mode` |

There are **two separate PPM implementations** for two different jobs — ALE
conservative remap (`rdb_remap_column.F90:227`) and ocean continuity/transport
face-reconstruction (`rdb_continuity.F90`). Separate code, same paper, **not
duplication** — each is shaped for its own loop/stencil/conservation
constraint.

### (b) Regime × backend matrix

| Horizontal tracer advect | Vertical (in-z) advect | ALE vertical remap |
|---|---|---|
| **PPM, HARDCODED (no knob)** (`tracer_advect_zonal_one_impl:1314`, `tracer_advect_meridional_one_impl:1384`; 2-cell near-wall band drops to 1st-order PCM/donor) | **1st-order UPWIND** (`src/core/ocean/kernels/vertical_advection/rdb_ocean_vertical_advection.F90:247` `tracer_advect_vertical_one_impl`, docstring "first-order upwind-in-z") | PCM/PLM/PPM via `remap_method` (default `"ppm"`); the parsed method is threaded through `rdb_ocean_setup.F90:500` → `vcoord%remap_method` → `rdb_ocean_dyn.F90:1061` |

### (c) Knobs

| Knob | file:line (decl) | Default | Selects | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `remap_method` | `src/core/rdb_config.F90:2030` (enum `:4097`, parse `src/ALE/rdb_vcoord.F90:628`) | `"ppm"` (pcm/plm/ppm/ppm_h4/pqm) | vertical ALE remap order | the ocean setup parses it into `vcoord%remap_method` (`rdb_ocean_setup.F90:838`) and the ocean remap caller passes it (`rdb_ocean_dyn.F90:1061`) |
| `ppm_limit_pos` | `src/core/rdb_config.F90:569` (parse `:2967-2968`) | `.false.` | positivity-limiter **modifier** on the ocean continuity PPM face values — not a scheme-family selector | ocean continuity |
| `positive_definite` | `src/core/rdb_config.F90` (`register_ocean_continuity`) | `.false.` | positive-definite split continuity **modifier**: `2·h_lim` PPM edge floor + per-donor θ outflux limiter ⇒ every layer `h ≥ h_lim` with zero mass created; `h_lim = angstrom_h` on VCOORD_LAGRANGIAN else 0. Mutually exclusive with `&ocean_wetdry_nml enable` | ocean continuity |

### (d) Honesty notes (the bits a reader will get wrong)

1. **`remap_method` drives the ocean ALE remap.** The ocean ALE remap honors it:
   `parse_remap_method(cfg%remap_method)` → `vcoord%remap_method`
   (`rdb_ocean_setup.F90:500`), passed through to the remap call
   (`rdb_ocean_dyn.F90:1061`). The `m = REMAP_PPM` in `rdb_ocean_remap.F90:121`
   is only the *fallback default for the optional `method` argument* — the
   caller always supplies one. (The *horizontal* tracer advect is the only
   hardcoded-PPM path; the ALE remap is not.)

## Equation of state

| EOS | ocean | Knob |
|---|---|---|
| Linear two-tracer | `default` | `&ocean_eos_nml eos="linear"` |
| Wright (1997) nonlinear | available | `&ocean_eos_nml eos="wright"` |
| Roquet et al. (2015) SpV (TEOS-10-class) | available | `&ocean_eos_nml eos="roquet_spv"` (not with `fv_wright` PGF) |

Linear-EOS reference state — `ρ = ρ_0 + β_S·(S−S_ref) − α_T·(T−T_ref)`:

| Parameter | Knob | Default | Units | Test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `α_T` | `&ocean_ic_nml alpha_T` | `1.7e-4` | kg/m³ per °C | `test_ocean_linear_eos_knobs` |
| `β_S` | `&ocean_ic_nml beta_S` | `7.6e-4` | kg/m³ per PSU | `test_ocean_linear_eos_knobs` |
| `T_ref` | `&ocean_ic_nml T_ref` | `10.0` | °C | `test_ocean_linear_eos_knobs` |
| `S_ref` | `&ocean_ic_nml S_ref` | `35.0` | PSU | `test_ocean_linear_eos_knobs` |
| `ρ_0` | `&ocean_ic_nml rho_0` | `1035.0` | kg/m³ | `test_ocean_linear_eos_knobs` |

`α_T`/`β_S` are **DIMENSIONAL** (kg/m³ per unit), not the fractional
1/°C, 1/PSU coefficients protocols usually quote — multiply those by
`ρ_0` first (`alpha_T = ρ_0·α`). See `docs/REFERENCE.md` §Equation of
state. The coastal-legacy `&tracer_nml alpha_T/beta_S/T_ref/S_ref`
spellings are RETIRED and fail loud at configure.

### Where α and β come from (E4)

`ρ_0`, `α_T` and `β_S` above are the LINEAR EOS's own coefficients.
Under `eos = "wright"` / `"roquet_spv"` they are not that EOS's
coefficients at all — the true α collapses toward zero at the freezing
point and grows strongly with pressure. `eos_buoyancy_coeffs` (and its
sign twin `eos_density_derivs`) evaluate `α = −∂ρ/∂T` and `β = +∂ρ/∂S`
from the ACTIVE EOS in closed form, per variant, as `pure elemental`
`!$acc routine seq` point routines. Measured (Wright, S = 34.5):

| state | α (kg/m³/°C) | vs the 10 °C value |
|---|---|---|
| −1.9 °C, 0 Pa | `2.619e-2` | ÷ 6.5 |
| −1.9 °C, 5e6 Pa (500 dbar) | `4.262e-2` | ÷ 4.0 |
| −1.9 °C, 1e7 Pa (1000 dbar) | `5.871e-2` | ÷ 2.9 |
| 10 °C (S = 35), 0 Pa | `1.711e-1` | — |

Which consumers take which:

| Consumer | Source of α/β | Pressure | Knob |
|---|---|---|---|
| KPP `B_0` (both passes of `vmix_kpp_overlay_impl`; also gates the non-local γ via `B_0 < 0`) | selectable | `ms%p_top` under `&ocean_psurf_nml in_eos`, else `eos%p_ref` — a SURFACE flux has no depth of its own | `&ocean_vmix_nml buoyancy_coeffs` |
| Double-diffusion density ratio `R_ρ = α·ΔT / β·ΔS` (`&ocean_ddiff_nml`) | selectable | true in-situ interface pressure, seeded from `ms%p_top` and accumulated `g·ρ₀·h` downward (EPBL's stack shape) | `&ocean_vmix_nml buoyancy_coeffs` |
| EPBL, kappa-shear, tidal mixing, isopycnal slopes, Redi | ALWAYS the active EOS (`eos_specvol_derivs`) | each builds its own in-situ stack; only EPBL seeds from `p_top` | — |
| PP81 N², convective-adjustment N², KPP bulk-Ri buoyancy, wave speed, MLE `b_ml`, `compute_pbce` | ALWAYS the active EOS — they difference `ms%rho_layer` itself | `eos%p_ref` (baked into `rho_layer`) | — |
| `ocean_cavity_const_t%alpha_T`/`beta_S` (hj99 / yung25 melt buoyancy) | its OWN pair, deliberately | n/a | none — ISOMIP+ Table 4 calibration constants, and **FRACTIONAL** (1/°C, 1/PSU), not the dimensional `eos_t` pair; left at their defaults by `configure_ocean_cavity` so ISOMIP+ comparability is not silently broken |
| Sea-ice coupler (`rdb_ice_ocean_coupler`) | reads no α/β and no density derivative at all | n/a | — |

| Source of α/β for KPP `B_0` + double diffusion | ocean | Knob | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| `constant` — the scalar `&ocean_ic_nml alpha_T`/`beta_S` pair, whatever the active EOS | `default` ⇒ bit-identical | `&ocean_vmix_nml buoyancy_coeffs="constant"` | `test_ocean_eos_buoyancy` |
| `eos` — `eos_buoyancy_coeffs` from the ACTIVE EOS, per column (KPP) / per interface (ddiff). BYTE-IDENTICAL to `constant` under `eos="linear"` (that branch returns the handle members themselves, not `−ρ²·dSV/dX`), so the knob only bites under a nonlinear EOS | available | `&ocean_vmix_nml buoyancy_coeffs="eos"` | `test_ocean_eos_buoyancy` |

`validate_config` **warns** (does not refuse) on cavity melt × nonlinear
EOS × `buoyancy_coeffs="constant"`: ISOMIP+ prescribes the linear EOS, so
every shipped cavity namelist is unaffected and keeps running untouched.

**Known, out of scope, and NOT introduced here:** the KPP `B_0` line is
`g·(α·q_T − β·q_S)` with a DIMENSIONAL α, i.e. it is missing the `1/ρ₀`
that turns `∂ρ` into a buoyancy — EPBL's twin of the same quantity has it
(`b0 = g·ρ₀·(dSV/dT·q_T + dSV/dS·q_S)`, and `dSV/dT = α/ρ₀²`). The two
therefore disagree by a factor ρ₀ for the same physical flux. E4 changes
only WHERE α comes from, in the same units, so the discrepancy is
untouched and the default stays bit-identical; fixing it moves every KPP
answer and belongs in its own PR.

## Initial conditions (analytical seeds)

| IC | ocean | Knob | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| Uniform T / S | `default` | `&tracer_nml initial_temperature / initial_salinity` | `test_ocean_salinity_ic` |
| Linear-in-layer T(z) (bed `k=1` → surface `k=nz`) | available | `&tracer_nml T_init_bottom` + `T_init_surface` (both non-zero) | `test_ocean_eady_ic` |
| Linear-in-layer S(z) (bed `k=1` → surface `k=nz`) | available | `&tracer_nml S_init_bottom` + `S_init_surface` (both non-zero; one alone fails loud) | `test_ocean_salinity_ic` |

## Boundary tracer fluxes (ocean path)

| Flux | ocean | Knob | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| Surface heat / salt (top layer `k=nz`) | scalar | `&ocean_thermo_nml q_heat / q_salt` | `test_ocean_surface_flux` |
| Surface-flux component set (`q_sw/q_lw/q_lat/q_sens/heat_added`, mass fluxes + `heat_content_*` enthalpy companions, `salt_flux`, `p_surf_atm`/`p_surf`; `Q_heat`/`Q_salt` become derived views assembled from the const + components) | per-component 2D | `&ocean_forcing_nml enable_components` (default off ⇒ no array allocated, `Q_heat`/`Q_salt` unchanged) | `test_ocean_surface_forcing_type` |
| Geothermal bottom heat (lowest massive layer at or above `k_bot`, `k=1` off `z_fixed`) | scalar | `&ocean_geothermal_nml enable / q_geo` | `test_ocean_geothermal` |
| Surface buoyancy restoring (top layer `k=nz` T/S → scalar targets, piston velocity; non-conservative) | scalar | `&ocean_restore_nml enable_restore_temp / enable_restore_salt` | `test_ocean_restore` |
| Tidal body forcing (equilibrium tide `η_eq`; momentum feels `−g∇(η−η_eq)` folded into the barotropic PGF; equilibrium-argument astronomy, 10 constituents, needs lat/lon grid) | barotropic | `&ocean_tides_nml enable` | `test_ocean_tides_astronomy`, `test_ocean_tidal_forcing` |
| Barotropic linear wave drag (Egbert & Ray 2001; Jayne & St Laurent 2001) — static per-face piston velocity `r_H` MULTIPLIED into `bt_rem_u/v` inside the BT substep; `form="uniform"` (global scalar) or `form="roughness_proxy"` (resolved-bathymetry-variance placeholder for the real subgrid `⟨h²⟩`, pending PR-14); composes with `substep_drag`.  Under `&vcoord_nml zfixed_closed_faces` both damp on the OPEN-column face depth `Σ_k h_face·open` (`bt_rem_open_impl` / `bt_rem_wave_drag_open_impl`), the column `ubt` is the mean of.  `substep_drag` reads only `&ocean_bdrag_nml r`, so under `form /= "linear"` it is a no-op (`r = 0`) or a drag the slow step never applies — configure WARNING | barotropic | `&ocean_bt_nml wave_drag` | `test_ocean_wave_drag`, `test_ocean_bt_upstream_zfixed` (`bt_rem_is_open_column`), `test_ocean_bt_substep_drag` (`warns_when_bdrag_not_linear`) |
| Atmospheric surface-pressure loading / inverse barometer (Wunsch & Stammer 1997) — `η_ib = −p_surf/(ρ₀·g_bt)` folded into the barotropic `eta_forcing` seam so momentum feels `−(1/ρ₀)∇p_surf` (~1 cm/hPa; a high depresses SSH); composes additively with the tide on the same seam; split-solver only, needs `enable_components` (reads `sf%p_surf`); ρ₀ from `eos%rho0` | barotropic | `&ocean_psurf_nml enable` | `test_ocean_p_surf`, `test_ocean_p_surf_bitident` |
| Reference density of the forcing terms — the `dt/(ρ₀·cp)` / `dt/ρ₀` divisors on EVERY surface heat/salt source (sea-ice coupling included), the wind-stress `τ/(ρ₀·h_top)`, the KPP `N²` / `u* = √(\|τ\|/ρ₀)` / kinematic fluxes behind `B_0`, and the geothermal `dt·Q_geo/(ρ₀·cp)` | not separately settable — all take `&ocean_ic_nml rho_0` | Fanned out from the ONE configured ρ₀ (`eos%rho0`) by `configure_ocean_reference_density`, joining the PGF and the twelve other slots that already took it. Before that wiring each slot kept a hard-coded 1035 that nothing assigned, so `rho_0 /= 1035` ran the EOS on the configured density and every forcing term on 1035, silently. `vmix%rho0` is the only one read on-device (inside `do concurrent`), and is correct because configure precedes `enter_data`. The implicit stress fold (`&ocean_vdiff_nml implicit_stress`) takes ρ₀ as an argument and now FAILS LOUD if it is omitted rather than defaulting to 1035. Default `rho_0 = 1035` ⇒ bit-identical.

| Top-of-column pressure in the EOS's IN-SITU argument (E3, ice-shelf-cavity prerequisite) — the assembled `sf%p_surf` is copied once per outer step into `ms%p_top` (Pa, always allocated + zero-filled + device-mapped), and the ported in-situ builder evaluates at `p_top + hydrostatic` instead of starting at 0 Pa at the free surface. Ported consumers: the FV-Wright Picard column sweep (`form="fv_wright"`) and, since Phase 4b, the EPBL column stack (`&ocean_epbl_nml`, gated by the host scalar `epbl%in_eos` — the seed moves BOTH consumers of that stack, the in-situ `eos_specvol_derivs` argument and the PE weight `dmass·p_mid·dsv`, because they are the same pressure; a uniform load is gauge-neutral under a linear EOS, measured exactly zero, and moves the answer under Wright through `α(p)`/`β(p)` alone). With no ported consumer selected it is a documented no-op (warned at configure). It deliberately does NOT touch `ms%rho_layer` — a POTENTIAL density at the horizontally uniform `&ocean_eos_nml p_ref`, differenced along layers and vertically, so a per-column reference would fabricate an along-layer density gradient (N² therefore unchanged and self-consistent). EOS ARGUMENT only — this knob leaves the PGF top boundary condition alone; injecting the same `ms%p_top` there is the separate, orthogonal `&ocean_pgf_nml p_top_in_bc` (FV-MOM6 `pa(nz+1)`, see the Pressure Gradient section; FV-Wright's `p_edge(nz+1) = 0` is still untouched). `validate_config` REFUSES `in_eos` with the STILL-unported in-situ builders (kappa-shear, tidal mixing, Redi, isopycnal slopes, PGF in-layer reconstruction, the FV-MOM6 in-situ PCM density `&ocean_pgf_nml insitu_density` under a pressure-dependent EOS, sea ice). NOTE the `in_eos` gate is not redundant with `p_top` being zero: a cavity fills `p_top` with the ice load either way, so the gate is what keeps a cavity run bit-identical | EOS in-situ pressure | `&ocean_psurf_nml in_eos` (default off ⇒ byte-identical) | `test_ocean_eos_p_top`, `test_ocean_bl_under_ice` |
| Potential-density reference pressure — the pressure `ms%rho_layer` is referenced to (Wright / Roquet; the linear EOS ignores it). Previously a declared-but-never-assigned `eos%p_ref` permanently stuck at 0; now a namelist knob. HORIZONTALLY UNIFORM BY DESIGN (a per-column reference would fabricate an along-layer density gradient). Selects the thermobaric state at which the effective α/β are evaluated — relevant near the freezing point at cavity pressures. Distinct from `&vcoord_nml rho_ref_pressure` (the RHO/HYCOM target-density coordinate + density-space diag remap); normally set both to the same value for a density-coordinate run | EOS | `&ocean_eos_nml p_ref` (default 0.0 ⇒ byte-identical) | `test_ocean_eos_p_top` |
| Freezing-point (liquidus) coefficient SET — `eos_freezing_point` evaluates the linear `T_f = λ1·S + λ2 + λ3·p` for every EOS variant (MOM6 `TFREEZE_FORM="LINEAR"` parity), with the triple carried on the `eos_t` handle (`tfr_s`/`tfr_0`/`tfr_p`) instead of hard-coded, so the ice slot's handle (`engine%state%eos`, read by frazil / frazil uptake / basal flux) and the vmix / EPBL / kappa-shear / tidal-mixing copies all inherit it. `"seaice"` = SIS2/MOM6 (−0.054, 0, −7.53e-8); `"isomip"` = ISOMIP+ (−0.0573, 0.0832, −7.53e-8), Asay-Davis et al. 2016 Table 4 p. 2483 / eq. (25) p. 2485. The two are ~0.031 °C apart at S = 34.5 — enough to flip the SIGN of an ice-shelf basal melt rate, hence a named-set knob rather than a silent choice. NAMED SETS ONLY (no free-form λ knobs: the triple is a fit); an unrecognised name is a fail-loud `validate_config` error; a NONLINEAR form (Millero 1978, TEOS-10 polynomial) would arrive at the documented dispatch seam in `eos_freezing_point`, not as another set. Assigned in `configure_ocean_drag`, the earliest configure stage — before every handle copy and before `enter_data` | EOS / sea ice | `&ocean_eos_nml tfreeze_set` (default `"seaice"` ⇒ bit-identical at every shipped call site, which all pass `p = 0`) | `test_ocean_freezing_point` |

## Sea ice (ocean path only — `&ocean_ice_nml`, default off ⇒ byte-identical)

SIS2 port on the ocean C-grid (`src/core/ice/`, 14 modules). The `enable`
master switch gates the whole subsystem — off (default) ⇒ the slot is never
initialised, mapped, or stepped ⇒ byte-identical. **A high-quality sea-ice
dynamical core and column model, not yet a sea-ice model**: the rows below
that carry a knob are landed and independently tested; the rows marked `—`
are absences documented on purpose (see `docs/CAPABILITIES_AND_LIMITATIONS.md`
§"Sea ice" for the physical consequence of each). Envelope: the slot runs on
the ocean decomposition, bit-identical to one rank (`test_ocean_decomp_bitid_mpi`
`sea_ice` / `sea_ice_transport`), except under a tripolar fold on more than one
rank (fail-loud at configure until the distributed fold lands); `transport`
runs across periodic edges and MPI seams; `dynamics` (EVP) allows wall/periodic
edges only, no tripolar fold, no OBC/tidal/sponge/clamped/Chapman edge. The authoritative knob set lives in the
`ocean_ice_config_t` / `&ocean_ice_nml` block of `src/core/rdb_config.F90`.

| Ice atmospheric forcing | `&ocean_ice_nml air_temp` / `restore_lambda` / `sw_down` — **v1 stub**: scalar, uniform, slab-restoring; no bulk formulae, no 2-D fields, no file input, no time dependence | `test_ocean_ice_driver_column` |
| Ice → ocean coupling | `enable` — salt ✓ closed (virtual); heat ✓ closed (incl. transmitted shortwave `sw_thru`, PR 31 — `ice_ocean_sw_flux` delivers it to `q_sw`/`Q_heat`); momentum ✗ **not conserved at fractional cover** (D7); freshwater/mass ✗ **not coupled at all** — ice carries no weight (no dynamic sea-surface loading) | `test_ocean_ice_coupling`, `test_ocean_ice_driver_column` |
| Ice initial condition (analytic seeding: seeds a live pack before the first step — no frazil growth required; mass binned into the ITD via `ice%mh_lim`, `enth_ice`/`enth_snow` set from `t_ice`/`s_ice` via the exact `ice_enth_from_ts` inversion) | `&ocean_ice_ic_nml conc_config` = `"zero"` (default, no-op) / `"uniform"` (scalar `h_ice`/`conc`/`h_snow`/`t_ice`/`s_ice`) / `"latitudes"` (SIS2 polar-cap 0/1 step off `geolatT`, needs a non-cartesian grid). v1 analytic-only — file-backed ICs deferred to PR-14 | `test_ocean_ice_init` |

Notes: `transport` and EVP `dynamics` both run under wall or periodic edges
and across MPI seams. With
`dynamics=.false.` ice velocity falls back to the ocean-surface-layer sampler;
with it on, `rdb_ice_evp` writes `ice%u_ice`/`v_ice` from the momentum solve.
`tdamp < 0` is the SIS2 special case `|tdamp|·dt_slow` for the elastic damping
timescale. `snowfall` spreads a uniform frozen-precipitation rate onto
`ice%atm_fprec` (v1 slab filler, same seam as `air_temp`/`sw_down`); the
ice-free share (open water at `ncat>1`, ice-free cells at `ncat==1`, and any
category failing the column's own entry gate) is delivered to the ocean as a
latent-heat sink + virtual freshening via `rdb_ice_snow%ice_snowfall_ocean_
share` — a DELIBERATE divergence from SIS2, which instead orphans that share
as snow on a zero-ice category (a state Roundabout's `rdb_ice_transport` treats as
a fail-loud violation). `cfl_trunc` (SIS2 `CFL_TRUNCATE`, default 0.5 there,
`0` here ⇒ byte-identical) clips the final ice velocity to the transport-CFL
bound, demoting `ice_transport_step`'s conservation/positivity abort to a
backstop rather than the only defence; `project_ci` (SIS2
`PROJECT_ICE_CONCENTRATION`, default `.true.` there, `.false.` here) projects
`ci` forward within the EVP subcycle loop so `pres_mice` stiffens under
convergence instead of holding the pre-loop value for the whole call — inert at
a saturated (`ci=1`) jam by construction. `snow_ice` converts submerged snow
mass to the top ice layer in ONE non-iterative Archimedes step
(`ice_snow_ice_flood`, `rdb_ice_mass`), exactly conserving column
mass/enthalpy/salt; it exchanges NOTHING with the ocean (SIS2's own
formulation — `snow_to_ice` is diagnostic-only). DIVERGENCE FROM PHYSICAL
REALITY (inherited from SIS2, not fixed here): the converted ice carries the
SNOW's enthalpy and ZERO salinity, not the flooding SEAWATER's — snow enthalpy
is far more negative than near-freezing seawater, so the new ice is too COLD
and too FRESH. True seawater flooding (drawing ocean mass + its
enthalpy/salinity into the pore space) is out of scope. Deferred: multi-rank,
ridging / mechanical
redistribution beyond `compress_ice`, real (non-virtual) freshwater mass for
the snowfall ocean share (PR-16). The `—`-in-the-ocean-column rows above are
documented absences, not omissions — an undocumented gap and a documented one
look identical from outside, which is why each has a row.

## Ice-shelf cavity basal melt (`&ocean_cavity_melt_nml`; ocean only, default off)

Kernel: `src/parameterizations/vertical/rdb_ocean_cavity_melt.F90`.
Coupling: `src/parameterizations/vertical/rdb_ocean_cavity_flux.F90` (the
`ocean_cavity_flux_t` slot, the far-field sampler and the per-thermo-step
driver), called from `engine_step_finalize` immediately BEFORE
`ocean_surface_flux_assemble`. Requires `&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml` (the draft,
the cover mask and the barotropic datum), `&ocean_eos_nml
tfreeze_set="isomip"` and `&ocean_forcing_nml enable_components`; every one of
those is a fail-loud configure requirement. Default off ⇒ bit-identical.

**v1 is VIRTUAL SALT, thermodynamics only.** The meltwater carries no mass, so
it adds no volume and no direct buoyancy (Phase 3); the ice-base MOMENTUM
sink is a separate opt-in (`&ocean_tdrag_nml`, above — off by default, and
sharing this group's `C_d` when on).  KPP and EPBL DO now feel the ice
(Phase 4b): their `u_*` is `√((stress_mag + stress_shelf)/ρ₀)`, where the
cover mask drives `stress_mag` to EXACTLY zero under a shelf and
`stress_shelf` carries the ice-ocean stress in its place.  Wind stress, surface
restoring, shortwave penetration and the uniform `&ocean_thermo_nml
q_heat/q_salt` are no longer refused: they are MASKED (see the cover-mask row
below).  `&ocean_psurf_nml` composes freely: the liquidus reads the assembled
`p_top = p_ice_ref + sf%p_surf`, so an atmospheric load under the shelf
depresses the freezing point with no extra wiring. See
`docs/CAPABILITIES_AND_LIMITATIONS.md`.

| Capability | ocean | Numerics | Primary test |
|---|---|---|---|
| Three-equation interface solve (liquidus + heat + salt) | `&ocean_cavity_melt_nml enable` | closed-form quadratic in `S_b` with the LARGER root (derived, no paper states it) and the cancellation-safe `q = −½(B + sign(B)√Δ)` form, because `Γ_S = Γ_T/35` puts production runs in the `\|B\| ≫ √(4AC)` corner; melt/freeze branch decided from `T*` BEFORE the solve, so it cannot disagree with its own answer; liquidus read off the `eos_t` handle (`&ocean_eos_nml tfreeze_set`), never duplicated | `test_ocean_cavity_melt` |
| Two-equation variant (`S_b = S_w`) | `&ocean_cavity_melt_nml enable` | the `γ_S → ∞` limit; IDENTICAL to the shipped sea-ice `rdb_ice_basal_flux` relax-to-`T_f` law at `γ_T·dt = h` (asserted, not asserted-to-be-similar) | `test_ocean_cavity_melt` |
| Exchange law `const_gamma` (`γ = Γ·u*`, Jenkins et al. 2010 / ISOMIP+) | `&ocean_cavity_melt_nml enable` | explicit in the melt rate; `Γ_T = 2.2e−2`, `Γ_S = Γ_T/35` are the ISOMIP+ STARTING GUESS, tuned per model (0.011–0.2 across the twelve ISOMIP+ submissions) — a knob, not a constant | `test_ocean_cavity_melt` |
| Exchange law `hj99` (Holland & Jenkins 1999 eqs. 14–18) | `&ocean_cavity_melt_nml enable` | turbulent + molecular sublayer with the McPhee `η*` stability parameter ⇒ IMPLICIT in the melt rate; outer bisection on `ln(L⁺)` (not Newton: the map kinks where the buoyancy flux changes sign); fail-loud at `f = 0` (the law has `\|f\|` in a logarithm and divides by it) | `test_ocean_cavity_melt` |
| Exchange law `yung25` (Yung et al. 2025 StratFeedback, eqs. 7–8) | `&ocean_cavity_melt_nml enable` | two power laws in `L⁺` capped at the Vreugdenhil & Taylor (2019) maxima ⇒ implicit, same bisection; its neutral limit is its OWN cap (0.012 / 3.9e−4), NOT the configured `Γ_T` | `test_ocean_cavity_melt` |
| Exchange laws `jenkins91` / `rosevear22` / `vt19` / `mk18` / `burchard22` / `jenkins21` | **RESERVED** (refused at configure) | enum values are nailed down and the dispatcher returns `CAVITY_MELT_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` — never a silent fallback to the default law. Each is implemented in the Python prototype `ice_shelf_melt/melt.py`, with its published ambiguities recorded there | `test_ocean_cavity_melt` (`reserved_laws_refuse`) |
| Ice conduction: insulating / H&J99 advective-diffusive | `&ocean_cavity_melt_nml enable` | insulating is the ISOMIP+ prescription (`κ_i = 0`); adv-diff collapses to `L_eff = L_f + c_i(T_b − T_ice)` via H&J99 eq. (31), zeroed on freezing as that paper prescribes, so the closed form survives and neither `H_I` nor `κ_I` is needed. The purely diffusive option is RESERVED (it moves the zero-melt point, so it changes the branch logic too) | `test_ocean_cavity_melt` |
| Friction velocity `u*` (tidal floor) | `&ocean_cavity_melt_nml enable` | `u* = max(√(C_d(u²+v²+u_tide²)), u*_min)` — ISOMIP+ eq. (27) + the Yung et al. (2025) floor; the tidal term belongs to the MELT `u*` only, never to the momentum drag | `test_ocean_cavity_melt` |
| **Far-field sampling** over `far_field_depth` METRES below the ice base | `&ocean_cavity_melt_nml far_field_depth` (10 m) | Thickness-weighted mean of `T`, `S` and the CELL-CENTRED velocity over the layers spanning that depth, with a PARTIAL last layer; vanished layers (`h ≤ H_VANISHED`) skipped, not clamped; `far_field_depth ≥ column` uses the whole column. **Metres, never "layer nz"** — the melt rate is roughly linear in the thermal driving it is handed, and the sampling distance is the dominant resolution artefact in the subject (Gwyther et al. 2020; Burchard et al. (2022) Table 2 p. 15, where the all-bulk error GROWS under refinement; Yung et al. (2026) p. 2074), so "layer nz" would make melt a function of the vertical coordinate's cell thickness — exactly what a coordinate study must hold fixed. Hold it FIXED across a coordinate sweep | `test_ocean_cavity_flux` |
| **Interface pressure** = `multilayer_state_t%p_top` | (implied by `enable`) | ONE pressure, THREE consumers: the FV-MOM6 pressure-stack surface BC, the in-situ EOS, and — with this slice — the melt liquidus. NOT `eos%p_ref` (a horizontally-uniform potential-density reference) and NOT the `eta_forcing` seam (a gradient). The melt path is a pure CONSUMER: the sole producer is `configure_ocean_cavity`'s `p_ice_ref + sf%p_surf` (P5.2), re-assembled per outer step when the psurf seam is live, so `configure_ocean_cavity_melt` writes nothing and instead ASSERTS `p_top >= p_ice_ref` on every cell (`cavity_count_unloaded_p_top`, exact because `p_surf >= 0`) — which catches a skipped or reordered producer rather than trusting the call order | `test_ocean_cavity_flux` (`ice_pump_deeper_melts_more`) |
| **Flux delivery** — the two OWNED components `heat_cavity` / `salt_cavity` | (implied by `enable`) | `heat_cavity = −q_ocean` (W/m², positive-down convention: `q_ocean > 0` warms the INTERFACE, so the ocean cools) and `salt_cavity = −m_mass·(S_far − s_ice)` (positive salinifies ⇒ melting freshens). NEVER `heat_added`/`salt_flux`, which the sea-ice coupler full-overwrites. The assembler folds both into `Q_heat`/`Q_salt` with a plain `+`; the filler latches `has_heat`/`has_salt` host-side and full-overwrites its own components each thermo step | `test_ocean_cavity_flux` (`flux_signs_cool_and_freshen`) |
| **Virtual salt flux** (`freshwater="virtual"`, the DEFAULT) | `&ocean_cavity_melt_nml freshwater` | `salt_cavity = −m_mass·(S_far − s_ice)` is the EXACT fixed-mass equivalent of adding mass `m_mass` at salinity `s_ice`: from `d(M·S)/dt = m·S_i` and `dM/dt = m`, `M·dS/dt = −m·(S − S_i)`. The heat twin of that dilution term, `−m·c_w·(T_w − T_b)`, is deliberately dropped — it is `m/(ρ_w·γ_T) ≈ 1e−3` of `q_ocean` because `T_w − T_b` is hundredths of a degree, whereas `S_far − s_ice ≈ 34 g/kg` makes the salt term the entire meltwater buoyancy signal. **Meltwater adds no VOLUME** in this mode — first-order for cavity circulation | `test_ocean_cavity_flux` (`virtual_salt_is_dilution_identity`) |
| **REAL freshwater MASS** (`freshwater="mass"`) | `&ocean_cavity_melt_nml freshwater` (default `"virtual"` ⇒ bit-identical) | `dh = m·dt/ρ₀` added to `h_layer(:,:,nz)`, `d(hS) = dh·s_ice`, `d(hT) = dh·T_b`, so the salinity falls by DILUTION and the closed form is `S(t) = S₀h₀/(h₀ + m t/ρ₀)`. **ρ₀, not the freshwater density**: the model is Boussinesq, its mass total IS `ρ·volume`, so a second density would put the tracked source and the tracked total on different scales. The heat reference is the model's implicit **0 °C** (`total_heat = Σ hT·area·ρ`), so in `hTr` space the enthalpy is simply `dh·T_b` — no heat capacity enters and the melt law's `c_w` never has to match the model's `c_p`. The virtual flux is NOT also applied to the tracer (that is the double count) but IS still assembled into `Q_salt`, because it is the entire meltwater buoyancy signal KPP/EPBL read for `B_0`; `ocean_cavity_mass_step` removes it again from salinity AND from the pseudo-salt mirror in the same stage, as the exact negation of the stamp. Passive tracers need nothing — `h` grows, `hC` does not. Applied IN-STAGE right after the surface-flux apply, so it spends the same `melt`, at the same stage weight, and `derive_bt_from_layers` puts the volume into `bt_eta` at the next stage with no barotropic forcing term. Refused with wet/dry and with `dt_tracer_advect_ratio > 1`, each naming its follow-up. Freezing that would drive the top layer through the vanish marker is clamped at `H_CAVITY_FLOOR = 2·H_VANISHED` — STRICTLY above it, because every thin-layer gate in the tree tests the marker with a strict `>`, so a layer left ON it reads as vanished and the next ALE remap's `c = hTr/h` guard returns 0, deleting the heat and salt the clamp was protecting — then counted, and FATAL.  A column already at or below the floor has the withdrawal REFUSED (`dh = 0`) rather than pinned up to it, so the clamp can never become a deposit | `test_ocean_cavity_freshwater` |
| **Sea-level compensation** (`volume_compensation="uniform_open_ocean"`) | `&ocean_cavity_melt_nml volume_compensation` (default `"none"`); requires `freshwater="mass"` | Each thermo step the domain-integrated melt volume is removed again, uniformly per unit area over the wet cells the ice does NOT cover, each parcel carrying that cell's own `T` and `S` (implemented as a top-layer RATIO `h_new/h_old` published in `comp_scale` and applied to EVERY tracer, so no concentration anywhere changes) and TRACKED as a sink in all three budgets. `"none"` is correct for a short run or an open boundary; for a CLOSED ISOMIP+ Ocean0 box it is metres per year of sea level (~30 m/yr over ~1e10 m² into ~4e10 m² of open surface). ISOMIP+ Sect. 3.1.3 leaves the restored Ocean0-2 uncompensated (their only seam is a restoring band that moves no volume) and allows compensation for the closed Ocean3/4. No open ocean at all ⇒ the withdrawal is exactly zero and the volume honestly stays in | `test_ocean_cavity_freshwater` |
| **Budgets** | (implied by `enable`) | Both components ride `Q_heat`/`Q_salt`, so they are integrated by the ordinary `ocean_surface_flux_apply_tracers` and land in the EXISTING `ms%heat_budget_surface` / `ms%salt_budget_surface` contributors — which the console already folds with the correct `ocean_budget_stage_weight`. No separate frazil-style accumulator and no full-weight/half-weight decision: the source is applied by the same per-stage kernel as every other surface flux, so it carries the same weight by construction. Under `freshwater="mass"` the same rule extends to MASS: the new host scalar `multilayer_state_t%mass_src` is accumulated with the SAME per-stage weight as `mass_out` and printed as the console's `src` on the `Mass` line, so `(M − M₀) + mass_out − mass_src` stays at round-off while the total grows; salt and heat still need no new accumulator because every real-mass increment is mirrored into the existing surface contributors | `test_ocean_cavity_flux` (`budget_closes_to_roundoff`), `test_ocean_cavity_freshwater`, `test_ocean_cavity_grounded_budget` |
| **Status accounting** | (implied by `enable`) | The per-column `CAVITY_MELT_*` plane is reduced ON DEVICE (`do concurrent … reduce`, never a host `count()` over a device-resident array) into four counters; `NONFINITE_INPUT`/`NONFINITE_STATE` on a covered column is **FATAL** (the safe state would hide an already-corrupt column behind a plausible run), while `NOT_CONVERGED` / `NO_PHYSICAL_ROOT` / `BAD_INPUT` / `NO_CORIOLIS` are COUNTED, warned, and given the kernel's zero-melt safe state. int64 running totals drain like `continuity_t%n_limited_total`. The fail-loud decision is a `pure` predicate (`cavity_melt_status_is_fatal`) so the suite tests it without provoking `error stop` | `test_ocean_cavity_flux` (`status_nonfinite_is_fatal`) |
| **Cover mask on ATMOSPHERIC forcing** | follows `&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml enable` (no knob of its own) | Under `cover_frac = 1` there is no atmosphere: every atmospheric term is scaled by `1 - cover_frac`, the cavity's own `heat_cavity`/`salt_cavity` are NOT.  Three sites, each chosen by what its consumers read.  (1) **The `tau` PAIR, at its source**, once from `configure_ocean_cavity` and again through `ocean_surface_stress_set_derived`'s optional `cover_frac` — masking the derived views would miss the implicit vdiff stress fold (`tau_u=ss%tau_x`) and the MLE front sampler, which read `tau` raw; the same call refreshes `stress_mag`, so KPP/EPBL `u*` is EXACTLY zero under cover.  FACE RULE: closed when EITHER neighbour is covered (`1 - max(cover_L, cover_R)`) — the only choice that leaves no wind on a covered cell; its price is a one-face front transition where the first OPEN cell keeps one live face and reads `\|tau\|/2`.  (2) **`ocean_surface_flux_assemble`** for `Q_heat_const`/`Q_salt_const`, `q_sw`/`q_lw`/`q_lat`/`q_sens`/`heat_added`, both `heat_content_mass*` and `salt_flux` — NOT at apply time, because `Q_heat`/`Q_salt` are what KPP/EPBL read for `B_0` and because the assembler is the last place the atmospheric and cavity bands are separable.  Components off ⇒ no assembler ⇒ the static scalar fill is masked once at configure (`ocean_surface_flux_apply_cover_const`).  (3) **SW penetration + surface restoring**, which route around `Q_*`, carry their own optional `cover_frac`.  Every path is an OPTIONAL argument (absent ⇒ byte-identical) and every mask is idempotent.  v1 cover is BINARY.  The one unreached path is `&ocean_dataovr_nml` file forcing (rewrites `tau`/`Q_heat` per bracket with no cover) — refused on the geometry group | `test_ocean_cavity_flux` (`cavity_cover_*`) |
| **Diagnostics** (13 derived-catalog entries) | `&ocean_cavity_melt_nml enable` (11) / `&ocean_cavity_dyn_nml enable` (2) | `melt` (kg m⁻² s⁻¹, + = melting), `melt_m_per_yr` (ISOMIP+ reporting unit: `/ρ_fw = 1000` × 365-day year, factor **31 536** exactly — Asay-Davis et al. 2016 §3.3; deliberately NOT the model ρ₀ = 1035, which is 3.5 % off every published figure), `thermal_driving` (`T_far − T_f(S_far, p_top)`), `haline_driving` (`S_far − S_b`), `tbdry`, `sbdry`, `tfreeze_ib` (the FAR FIELD's in-situ liquidus at the ice base — its difference from `tbdry` is the three-equation correction, which is why both ship), `exch_vel_t`/`exch_vel_s` (the CONVERGED γ_T/γ_S, carried on the slot by `cavity_melt_point_gamma`: under `hj99`/`yung25` they are implicit in the interface state, so a diagnostic that re-derived them from `u*` would report the NEUTRAL values), `ustar_shelf`, `cavity_melt_status`; plus the geometry pair `z_draft` and `water_column` (= `bt_H_ref + bt_eta`, the datum identity, gated on the geometry group alone). MISSING-VALUE CONVENTION: IEEE NaN outside the cover (masked by `cavity_flux%active` — covered AND wet AND the sample found mass — not by `cover_frac`), never zero, so a domain mean is a CAVITY mean; the console reports `missing=n/total` and the NetCDF variable carries `_FillValue`. A diagnostic requested without its prerequisite knob FAILS LOUD at configure rather than registering a plane of missing values | `test_ocean_cavity_diags` |

Notes: every solver returns a `CAVITY_MELT_*` status instead of `error stop` —
a `pure` `!$acc routine seq` procedure can neither log nor abort, and one bad
column must not take the run down. On any non-OK status the outputs are the
documented SAFE STATE (`m_mass` EXACTLY zero, `S_b = S_w`,
`T_b = T_f(S_w, p_b)`) so a failed column contributes nothing to a budget
rather than a plausible wrong number. Every clamp is `ieee_is_finite`-guarded
BEFORE the min/max, per the repo's NaN-laundering hazard.  The data-parallel
seam is `cavity_melt_columns` (a `do concurrent` over columns, inside the
module): on the GPU build nvlink cannot resolve a `!$acc routine seq` symbol
out of `librdb_core.so` into a `do concurrent` compiled in another translation
unit, so the coupling PR must extend that routine rather than write its own
column loop in the engine.

## Diagnostics (no feedback on the dynamics)

| Diagnostic | ocean | Numerics | Primary test |
|---|---|---|---|
| First-baroclinic wave speed + Rossby radius (B1; Chelton et al. 1998) | `&ocean_wavespeed_nml enable` (default off) | per-column rigid-lid Sturm–Liouville eigensolve from `rho_layer`; backtracking convective merge + fixed-budget Sturm-count bisection; called once per outer step (thermo-cadence-gated, further gated by `n_wavespeed`) in `ocean_dyn_step_split`, BEFORE `varmix_compute`/`run_meke_step` — feeds B2 (GM/Redi/MEKE resolution scaling). `rd_over_dx = rd/metrics%dxT` (metres, not `grid%dx` — degrees on spherical/supergrid/tripolar); `f_centre`/`beta_centre` come from `metrics_fill_coriolis` (planetary or beta-plane), not a hard-coded beta-plane. `ocean_dyn_step` (the unsplit path) does not call it — trap #5, PR-3. | `test_ocean_wave_speed` |

---

## Tunable parameters (key dials per scheme)

The *curated* dial set — defaults are the namelist defaults (`0` / `.false.` =
off/inert). The exhaustive per-field list (units, CF metadata) is the `config_t`
docstrings (FORD) + [`REFERENCE.md`](REFERENCE.md).

**Porous barriers** — `&ocean_porous_nml` (ocean only)

| Knob | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enable` | `.false.` | Master switch. Off ⇒ the open-area fields stay at their `(1,1,1)` placeholder and no porous kernel is launched (byte-identical). Fails loud with `&ocean_bt_nml bt_halo > 0` and with `&ocean_wetdry_nml enable`. |
| `source` | `"resolved"` | Along-face statistics source. `"resolved"` = wet-gated corner/midpoint samples of the RESOLVED bathymetry (a proxy). `"file"` = offline subgrid file — fails loud, deferred. |
| `eta_interp` | `"max"` | Interface height at the velocity point (MOM6 `PORBAR_ETA_INTERP`): `max` (the higher/shallower interface — the LEAST blocking, since `w` increases with height), `min` (the most blocking), `arithmetic`, `harmonic`. |
| `masking_depth` | `0.0` m | Faces whose mean along-face depth is SHALLOWER than this stay fully open (MOM6 `PORBAR_MASKING_DEPTH`, positive below the surface). |

**Implicit stress/drag fold** — `&ocean_vdiff_nml` (ocean path only; folds the
surface wind stress + bottom drag into the backward-Euler vertical-friction
tridiagonal as BCs instead of explicit pre-solve adds — thin-layer
(z*/ZSTAR_FULL pinch-out) CFL-robust). Both default off ⇒ bit-identical.
| Knob | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `implicit_stress` | `.false.` | Wind stress → vdiff surface (`k=nz`) RHS row (Neumann top-BC). Incompatible with `&ocean_vmix_nml direct_stress`. |
| `implicit_drag` | `.false.` | Bottom drag → vdiff bed-row diagonal (stress bottom-BC; the row is `k_bot_u/v`, `k=1` off `z_fixed`, and the rows below it are the identity). Mutually exclusive with `&ocean_bdrag_nml implicit`, and with HBBL (`hbbl>0` — the fold is one 2-D rate, a band needs a per-layer one) unless `bbl_glue` replaces it. |
| `hvel_mom6` | `.false.` | MOM6 momentum face thickness `hvel` + arithmetic `h_shear` (`vertvisc_coef`); `.false.` = the historical arithmetic `h_u`. |
| `hvel_harmonic` | `.false.` | MOM6 `HARMONIC_VISC`: `.false.` = MOM6 default branch (arithmetic, harmonic near the bed for thin→thick flow, height above bed `max(zh, z_clear)` so face layers below the shallower bed of a step sit in the BBL, `MOM_vert_friction.F90:1497-1530`); `.true.` = harmonic branch with the `hvel_upwind` blend (lines 1479-1495). |
| `bbl_glue` | `.false.` | MOM6 `BOTTOMDRAGLAW` — see the Bottom drag table. Requires `hvel_mom6`. |
| `hbbl_visc` | `10.0` m | botfn scale without the glue; the glue's HBBL when `&ocean_bdrag_nml hbbl = 0`. |
| `implicit_top_drag` | `.false.` | Ice-shelf top drag → vdiff surface (`k=nz`) diagonal, AND the wind-stress RHS on that row scaled by `(1 − cover)` so a covered face takes the drag and no wind. Requires `&ocean_tdrag_nml enable`; mutually exclusive with `&ocean_tdrag_nml implicit` and with `htbl>0`. Test: `test_ocean_top_drag`. |

**Barotropic linear wave drag** — `&ocean_bt_nml` (ocean path only; bulk
energy sink for the barotropic tide, Egbert & Ray 2001 / Jayne & St Laurent
2001). `wave_drag=.false.` (default) ⇒ bit-identical. `form="uniform"` needs
`wave_drag_r_uniform>0` (a warning fires if not). `form="roughness_proxy"` is
a documented PLACEHOLDER — resolved-bathymetry `⟨grad b⟩²` variance, not the
real subgrid `⟨h²⟩` (pending PR-14's file reader / PR-30). `form="file"` is
registered but fails loud at configure (not implemented — PR-14).
| Knob | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `wave_drag` | `.false.` | Master switch. |
| `wave_drag_form` | `"uniform"` | `"uniform"` \| `"roughness_proxy"` \| `"file"` (fail-loud, unimplemented). |
| `wave_drag_scale` | `1.0` | Global tuning multiplier on `r_H`. |
| `wave_drag_r_uniform` | `0.0` | Piston velocity `r_H` (m/s) for `form="uniform"`. |
| `wave_drag_kappa` | `6.2832e-4` | Topographic wavenumber (1/m) for `form="roughness_proxy"` (matches `&ocean_tidal_mixing_nml kappa_itides`). |
| `wave_drag_n_bot` | `1.0e-3` | Reference bottom `N` (1/s) for `form="roughness_proxy"`. |
| `wave_drag_h2_max` | `2.5e4` | Ceiling on the `⟨h²⟩` proxy (m²) for `form="roughness_proxy"`. |

**PP81 + KPP constants** — `&ocean_vmix_nml` (routes to
`ocean_state%vmix`). `kv_bg`/`kt_bg`/`ks_bg` (the assembly floor,
`vmix_assemble`) are re-derived from `pp81_nu_bg`/`pp81_kappa_bg` at
configure time (`vmix_seed_backgrounds`) so the floor tracks a user-set
background rather than the type default.
| Knob | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `pp81_nu0` | `1e-2` | PP81 Richardson-dependent viscosity scale (m²/s). |
| `pp81_nu_bg` | `1e-4` | PP81 background viscosity (m²/s); also seeds `vmix%kv_bg`. |
| `pp81_kappa_bg` | `1e-5` | PP81 background diffusivity (m²/s); also seeds `vmix%kt_bg`/`ks_bg`. |
| `pp81_alpha` | `5.0` | Ri scaling in `ν = ν_bg + ν₀/(1+α·Ri)²` (paper value 5; implementations vary 4-10). |
| `shear2_floor` | `1e-10` | Floor on `\|∂u/∂z\|²+\|∂v/∂z\|²` in the PP81 Ri denominator (1/s²). |
| `kpp_ri_crit` | `0.3` | Critical bulk Richardson number for the KPP BL-depth sweep (LMD94 §3). |
| `kpp_cs_nonlocal` | `6.3` | Non-local (counter-gradient) transport coefficient `C_s` (LMD94 eq 20). |
| `kpp_c_vt2` | `1.8` | Unresolved-shear `V_t²` coefficient (LMD94 eq 23); `0` disables `V_t²`. |

**Along-coordinate tracer Laplacian (ocean path)** — `&ocean_hdiff_nml`
(`rdb_ocean_hdiff_tracer`). Diffusion along the model coordinate, NOT along
neutral surfaces (`&ocean_redi_nml` is the separate neutral/isopycnal path).
Default `kappa_h = 0.0` keeps the kernel's short-circuit intact ⇒
bit-identical. Configure-time guard aborts if
`kappa_h·dt_therm·(1/dx²+1/dy²) > 0.5` (Cartesian-metres check; skipped on
spherical/tripolar grids and when `dt_fixed` is adaptive).
| Knob | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `kappa_h` | `0.0` | Horizontal tracer diffusivity (m²/s); `0` = no-op. |

**EPBL** — `&ocean_epbl_nml` (ocean path only; replaces the KPP overlay, PP81
interior + background continue underneath).  Full knob table + the MOM6 name
mapping: [`docs/generated_nml_knobs.md`](generated_nml_knobs.md); the
load-bearing dials:
| Knob | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enable` | `.false.` | Master switch (requires `use_closure` + thermodynamics; logs + disables `use_kpp`). |
| `mstar_scheme` | `"om4"` | Mechanical-TKE efficiency: `constant` / `om4` / `rh18`. |
| `mstar` | `1.2` | Constant-scheme mstar. |
| `nstar` | `0.2` | Convective-PE → TKE efficiency. |
| `tke_decay` | `2.5` | Ekman-depth / TKE-decay-scale ratio. |
| `mld_iteration` | `.true.` | Self-consistent MLD root-find (false position, `mld_tol = 1 m`). |
| `translay_scale` | `0.1` | Transition-layer mixing-length floor. |
| `prandtl` | `1.0` | `Kv = prandtl · Kd` into the momentum solve. |
| `combine` | `"add"` | Fold into PP81 kv/kt additively or by `max`. |
| `tke_diags` | `.false.` | Per-column TKE budget terms (close to round-off; asserted by `test_ocean_epbl`). |
| `use_lt` | `.false.` | Langmuir enhancement of mstar — LF17 wind-only statistical waves (one La per column from u* + MLD; no wave model). `lt_scheme = "rescale"\|"additive"`, Reichl & Li (2019) coefficients, `lt_lac1..5` stability modification. |

**kappa-shear** — `&ocean_kappa_shear_nml` (ocean path only; interior
closure, coexists with KPP/EPBL — its κ is ADDED to `kt` and
`prandtl_turb·κ` to `kv` every stage; the column solve runs at thermo
cadence).  Full knob table + the upstream-name mapping:
[`docs/generated_nml_knobs.md`](generated_nml_knobs.md); the
load-bearing dials:
| Knob | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enable` | `.false.` | Master switch (requires `use_closure` + thermodynamics; no exclusions). |
| `ri_crit` | `0.25` | Critical Richardson number for the shear source. |
| `shearmix_rate` | `0.089` | Source-rate coefficient (JHL08 calibration). |
| `kappa_0` | `1.0e-7` | Background κ floor / well-posedness smoothing (m²/s). |
| `tol_err` | `0.1` | Picard convergence tolerance (also scales the adaptive-dt bands). |
| `max_inner_it` / `max_substep_it` | `50` / `13` | Inner Picard / outer substep caps. |
| `prandtl_turb` | `1.0` | `Kv = prandtl_turb · Kd` on the momentum side of the merge. |
| `massless_merge` | `.false.` | D4: fold vanished (`< H_VANISHED`) layers onto the column's massive sub-grid before the solve (vs the blunt gather floor); identity columns bypass, so on-path is bit-identical on healthy envelopes. |
| `at_vertex` | `.false.` | MOM6 `VERTEX_SHEAR` (OM5-class production form): solve the columns at C-grid CORNERS from the native face velocities (no centre-average shear damping), then average corner Kd back to tracer points.  Kv is routed corner→face (`prandtl_turb·kd_corner` into `vdiff_apply_momentum`'s `kv_corner_source`, MOM6 `Kv_shear_Bu`) with the cell-centred kv merge suppressed; `tke_int` zeroed in vertex mode. |
| `vertex_geometric_mean` | `.false.` | Geometric (vs arithmetic) corner→centre Kd mean (MOM6 `VERTEX_SHEAR_GEOMETRIC_MEAN`). |
| `vertex_geomean_kdmin` | `0.0` | Floor (m²/s) on each corner Kd BEFORE the geometric mean (MOM6 `VERTEX_SHEAR_GEOMETRIC_MEAN_KDMIN`; inert unless geometric).  With 0 the geometric mean hard-zeros Kd at every shear-zone edge; OM5 configs use `1e-9`. |

**Vmix assembly gate** — `&ocean_vmix_nml` (ocean path only; the single
downstream floor/clip/smooth/guard stage `vmix_assemble`, run once per stage
after every closure has contributed into kv/kt and `vmix_split_kd_heat_salt`
has derived ks from kt).  All defaults are bit-identical to the pre-assembly
chain.
| Knob | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `kv_max` | `huge` (off) | Ceiling on momentum viscosity kv (MOM6 `Kd_max` momentum). |
| `kd_max` | `huge` (off) | Ceiling on tracer diffusivity kt/ks (MOM6 `Kd_max`). |
| `kd_smooth_iterations` | `0` | 1-2-1 horizontal smoothing passes on kv/kt/ks (MOM6 `Kd_smooth`). |
| `vmix_guard` | `.false.` | Debug-gated negative/NaN diffusivity guard (error-stop, or status-returning testable path). |

**Geothermal bottom heat flux** — `&ocean_geothermal_nml` (ocean path only;
bed-side analogue of the surface heat flux, deposited into the lowest massive
layer)
| Knob | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enable` | `.false.` | Master switch (default off ⇒ bit-identical to no geothermal). |
| `q_geo` | `0.0` | Constant bottom heat flux (W/m², positive into the ocean; typical ~0.05–0.1). |

**Surface buoyancy restoring** — `&ocean_restore_nml` (ocean path only;
relaxes the surface top layer T/S toward scalar targets at rate
`λ = piston/h_top`; piston-velocity form, MOM6 `RESTOREBUOY`-inspired;
non-conservative — increment mirrored into the surface heat/salt budget)
| Knob | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enable_restore_temp` | `.false.` | Master switch for SST restoring (effective only when `piston_t /= 0`). |
| `enable_restore_salt` | `.false.` | Master switch for SSS restoring (effective only when `piston_s /= 0`). |
| `piston_t` | `0.0` | SST piston velocity (m/day, MOM6 `FLUXCONST_T`; converted to m/s at seed). |
| `piston_s` | `0.0` | SSS piston velocity (m/day, MOM6 `FLUXCONST_S`). |
| `restore_sst` | `0.0` | Scalar target SST (degC). |
| `restore_sss` | `0.0` | Scalar target SSS (PSU). |

**Ocean** dials live in the per-concern `&ocean_<group>_nml` sub-namelists
(`vmix`, `hvisc`, `bdrag`, `pgf`, `coriolis`, …) — see the working envelope in
[`CAPABILITIES_AND_LIMITATIONS.md`](CAPABILITIES_AND_LIMITATIONS.md).

<!-- TODO: windowed tracer advect (dt_tracer_advect_ratio) — add a row to a
     tracer-advection cadence section when the tracer-advection matrix branch
     (docs/tracer-advection-matrix) merges; the scheme lives in
     continuity_t (rdb_continuity.F90) and is gated by &ocean_vmix_nml. -->

## Keeping this current

1. **Per-capability PR step.** The CLAUDE.md "adding a new capability" workflow
   gains a step: *namelist knob → kernel → unit test → **closure-matrix row** →
   pre-commit + fortitude → ctest → commit.* One row per scheme is cheap.
2. **Automated gate.** `tools/check_closure_matrix.py` parses the closure knobs
   from `src/core/rdb_config.F90` namelists and the ocean sub-namelists, asserts
   each appears somewhere in this file, and checks that every test named here
   exists in `tests/CMakeLists.txt`. Wired into pre-commit + CI so drift fails
   the build instead of rotting silently (this matrix was born because the prose
   in `CAPABILITIES_AND_LIMITATIONS.md` drifted — it still claims PP81 is the
   only coastal mixing scheme, three closures ago).
