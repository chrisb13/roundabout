!! Ocean restart / checkpoint manager + per-slot field registry.
module rdb_ocean_restart
   !! Restart cadence + per-slot checkpoint registry for the ocean
   !! dyn-core.  Each prognostic-owning slot registers its arrays at
   !! birth; the manager walks the registry to do the I/O, so new
   !! state-carrying slots join by registering rather than editing here.
   !!
   !! Contract (MPI-native):
   !!   1. FULL local arrays — every registered array is written/read at
   !!      its TOTAL local extent (interior + ghosts).  Physical wall
   !!      ghosts are genuine owned boundary state (nothing rebuilds them),
   !!      so an interior-only write breaks the bit-exact gate; periodic/
   !!      fold/halo seam ghosts are redundant but harmless to save.
   !!   2. Decomposition + grid metadata (px, py, dims, i/j_start, nz,
   !!      nghost, vcoord, tracer set) live in the file; resume requires
   !!      the SAME decomposition and error-stops on mismatch.  Cross-rank
   !!      redistribution is an offline tool, never in-Fortran.
   !!   3. Global scalars (time, step, outer_step_count) are rank-0's.
   !!   4. A registered field is REQUIRED by default (missing on read is
   !!      FATAL); mark genuinely optional entries `optional=.true.`.
   !!
   !! Device sync: `device_mapped` arrays (default) are pulled with
   !! `!$acc update self` before the host NetCDF write; host-only state
   !! (`device_mapped=.false.`) is skipped so `update self` is never
   !! issued on an unmapped array.  The read path runs BEFORE
   !! `ocean_state_enter_data`, writing the host interior so the
   !! subsequent enter_data carries values up to the device.
