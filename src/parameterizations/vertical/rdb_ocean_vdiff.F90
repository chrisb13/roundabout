!! Backward-Euler vertical diffusion solver for the ocean multilayer
!! C-grid.  Two public entry points:
!!
!!   * `vdiff_apply_momentum` — implicit vertical viscosity
!!     on `u_face_x_layer` and `v_face_y_layer`.
!!   * `vdiff_apply_tracers` — implicit vertical diffusivity on every
!!     registered tracer (operates on `T = hTr/h`, writes back
!!     `hTr = T*h`; `h_layer` is untouched).  Takes TWO diffusivity
!!     sources, `kt_source` (temperature) and `ks_source` (salinity +
!!     every passive tracer, MOM6's `Kd_salt` convention) — see the
!!     routine's own docstring for the three-case dispatch.
!!
!! Both routines build a tridiagonal system per cell column and
!! solve in-place via the Thomas algorithm:
!!
!!   (1 + α_k + β_k) T_k^{n+1} - α_k T_{k+1}^{n+1} - β_k T_{k-1}^{n+1} = T_k^n
!!
!! with
!!   α_k = dt * K_v / (h_k * dz_face_{k+1})
!!   β_k = dt * K_v / (h_k * dz_face_k)
!!   dz_face_k = 0.5 * (h_{k-1} + h_k)
!!
!! Bed (`k = 1`) sets `β_1 = 0`; surface (`k = nz`) sets `α_nz = 0`
!! → closed top and bottom (no surface heat / wind-stress flux here;
!! those are separate kernels that add to the right-hand side).
!!
!! Backward-Euler is unconditionally stable, so the per-step
!! constraint is purely accuracy — `dt * K_v / h² ≲ 1` for the
!! diffusion-time scale to be resolved.  KPP-style large K_v in the
!! surface boundary layer (~1e-1 m²/s) over a 1 m layer at dt = 10 min
!! ⇒ `dt*K_v/h² ~ 60` — still stable, but the resolved decay rate
!! is heavily damped (which is the right thing under strong mixing).
!!
!! Per-column work is serial in k (Thomas recurrence); parallelism
!! is `do concurrent (j, i)`.

      ! UNCONDITIONALLY, from descriptor extents/strides it only loaded

      ! 160 valgrind "conditional jump depends on uninitialised value(s)"

      ! routine's stack frame.  Benign (the null check still gates the free)
      ! but real, and it is the compiler reading OUR uninitialised stack.
      !
      ! Declaring the shape removes the decision at its source: an
      ! explicit-shape dummy is contiguous by definition, so there is no
      ! flag, no temporary, no free, nothing to read — and, unlike the
      ! CONTIGUOUS attribute (tried and reverted during the cavity stack), it
      ! keeps working on nvfortran.  CONTIGUOUS on an assumed-shape OPTIONAL
      ! makes nvfortran
      ! 26.5 hand the callee an offset-adjusted, NON-NULL address for an
      ! ABSENT actual; the implicit present-or-copyin the compiler emits for
      ! the impl's explicit-shape dummy then loses its null short-circuit
      ! and issues a real `cuMemcpyHtoD` off that garbage pointer
      ! (`__pgi_uacc_dataonb ... 'tau_face(:,:)'` -> SIGSEGV, 44/220 tests
      ! on `-stdpar=gpu -gpu=cc70,mem:separate`).  An explicit-shape dummy
      ! carries no descriptor at all, so an absent actual stays a clean
      ! null and the runtime skips it, exactly as it does today.
      !
      ! The bounds are the ones the body already derives and the impl
      ! already assumes: `multilayer_state_t%init` allocates the u-face
      ! arrays `(nx_total + 1, ny_total, nz_ml)` and the v-face arrays
      ! `(nx_total, ny_total + 1, nz_ml)` off this same `grid`.  Every
      ! actual is a whole allocatable slot component or a whole local array,
      ! never a strided section (the GPU path already requires that: these

         !! bit-identically what it has always been):
         !!
         !! 1. the face thickness becomes `min(h_L, h_R)` instead of the
         !!    arithmetic (or MOM6-harmonic) mean — the standard
         !!    partial-cell choice, and the one that makes "this layer is
         !!    an inert FILLER on at least one side" visible locally as
         !!    `hvel(k) <= H_VANISHED`;
         !! 2. the tridiagonal coupling across an interface touching such
         !!    a layer is CUT (`alpha = beta = 0`), and the layer's own
         !!    row is forced to the identity.
         !!
         !! Without (2) an OPEN layer is frictionally coupled, every
         !! single step, to the CLOSED layer above or below it — whose
         !! velocity `mask_layer_velocities` has just zeroed — so the
         !! wall acts as a spurious side drag instead of as free-slip.
         !! The floor `max(hvel, H_VANISHED)` does not save it: it makes
         !! the coupling huge-but-finite (`dt·nu/1.5e-4`), i.e. a rigid
         !! glue to zero, which is the worst of the three options.
         !!
         !! This is the DYNAMIC twin of `metrics%open_u/open_v`: "filler
         !! on either side" is `min(h_L,h_R) <= H_VANISHED` here and
         !! `target_h <= H_VANISHED` on either side there, and under
         !! `z_fixed` the two agree (η is absorbed by the first LIVE
         !! layer).  It is derived locally rather than threaded as a 3-D
         !! mask because this kernel is reached through four flat-impl
         !! call sites and five dispatcher call sites, none of which sees
         !! `ocean_metrics_t`, and a scalar costs nothing.
